"""Verify documentation links without touching the network.

Three surfaces render this project's Markdown, each against a different base URL:

    GitHub repo view   https://github.com/<slug>/blob/main/...   relative links work
    PyPI project page  https://pypi.org/project/<name>/          relative links BREAK
    Pages site         https://<org>.github.io/<name>/           relative links work in docs/

1.0.0 shipped `](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json)` in README.md, which PyPI resolved to
`https://pypi.org/project/<name>/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — a 404
that looked fine on GitHub. That class of bug is invisible to a human reviewer and to
`mkdocs build`, so it gets its own check.

Rules enforced:

  1. Root Markdown (README, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT) must contain
     NO relative links — PyPI and the Pages site cannot resolve them.
  2. Every absolute URL into this repo (`/blob/main/<p>` or `/tree/main/<p>`) must name a
     path that actually exists, and blob-vs-tree must match file-vs-directory.
  3. Relative links inside docs/ must resolve on disk (mkdocs --strict also covers this,
     but this runs without installing mkdocs).
  4. No link may reference the former publishing org (the project was developed as
     TheViziusGroup/vibe-engineering-skills and republished under the maintainer's own
     account as vibey-skills). The only file allowed to name the old coordinates is
     NOTICE.md, which exists precisely to record the attribution; everywhere else a
     stale org URL is a bug — every such link must point at the canonical slug below.

Deliberately hermetic: no HTTP requests. A link checker that needs the network is a link
checker that gets disabled the first time CI flakes. Reachability of third-party URLs is out
of scope; correctness of our own paths is not.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on any violation.
