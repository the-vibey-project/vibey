# AGENTS.md

Guidance for Codex when working in this repository.

## What this repo is

This is a **Codex plugin marketplace**: 135 plugins composed of 710 Agent Skills,
shipped inside the `vibey` distribution under the MIT license — `vibey-skills` is a
workspace tenant, not a separate PyPI project (vibey ADR-0037). The application code is the
packaging CLI plus the retrieval context engine (`src/vibey_skills/context_engine.py`,
behind `vibey-skills index / search / packet / evaluate`) — but the deliverable is still
the Markdown and JSON that define the plugins. "Correctness" means valid manifests and
accurate, well-triggered skill content.

## Source of truth

- [.claude-plugin/marketplace.json](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey-skills/blob/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) — the marketplace
  manifest Codex reads when this repo is added with `/plugin marketplace add`. Each
  entry's `source` points at a directory under `plugins/`.
- [plugins/](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey-skills/tree/main/plugins) — the authoritative plugin sources. Edit skills here.

`plugins/` must stay at the repository root: Codex requires
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` at the root with `source: ./plugins/<name>`. The Python
wheel force-includes that same tree instead of duplicating it, so there is exactly one copy
of every skill file.

## Plugin structure

```
plugins/<plugin-name>/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json    Manifest: name, version, description, author
  README.md                     Human overview + bullet list of skills
  skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md  One skill per directory
```

### plugin.json

```json
{
  "name": "agile-delivery",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Agile Delivery: …",
  "author": { "name": "Adam Matthew Steinberger", "email": "adam@matthewsteinberger.com" }
}
```

`name` must match both the directory name and the `name`/`source` in
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

### SKILL.md

YAML frontmatter then Markdown body:

```markdown
---
name: delivery-velocity
description: Use when … Triggers on … Also triggers on …
---

# Delivery Velocity

<body>
```

- `name` (required) matches the skill directory name (kebab-case).
- `description` (required) is the trigger. Write it as "Use when …" plus concrete trigger
  phrases — this is the only thing Codex sees when deciding whether to load the skill, so
  be specific about the tasks, tools, and terms that should activate it.
- Keep the body self-contained and evidence-grounded; cite sources where claims are made.

## Conventions

- `author` is always `{ "name": "Adam Matthew Steinberger", "email":
  "adam@matthewsteinberger.com" }`, in both
  `plugin.json` and each `marketplace.json` entry, and the same identity is used for
  `authors`/`maintainers` in `pyproject.toml`. The MIT copyright in `LICENSE` is held
  jointly by **The Vizius Group** (where the project was originally developed as
  `vibe-engineering-skills`) and **Adam Matthew Steinberger**; `NOTICE.md` records the
  republication. Do not remove either line.
- Skills are general-purpose. Never add content that documents a specific organization's
  internal systems, hostnames, ticket IDs, or personnel; that belongs in a private
  marketplace, not this public one.
- Versioning is per-plugin semver in `plugin.json`. Most plugins are `0.1.0`; revised ones
  are `0.2.0`.
- The package version in `pyproject.toml` (single-sourced from
  `src/vibey_skills/__init__.py:__version__`) must equal `marketplace.json`'s
  `metadata.version`. The validator enforces this.
- Plugin and skill names are kebab-case and must be unique within the marketplace.

## When you change a plugin

1. Edit the skill(s) under `plugins/<name>/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`.
2. Bump `version` in `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.
3. Mirror `version`, `description`, and `category` into the matching entry in
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
4. Update `plugins/<name>/README.md` and the plugin table in the root
   [README.md](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey-skills/blob/main/README.md) if the skill list or summary changed.
5. Run both checkers — each must exit 0:
   ```bash
   python3 tools/validate_manifests.py
   python3 tools/check_links.py
   ```

Keep `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and the per-plugin `plugin.json` files in sync —
a mismatch in `name` or `source` will break installation.

## Documentation links: absolute at the root, relative under `docs/`

This is a hard rule, not a style preference, because three renderers resolve links against
three different base URLs:

| Surface | Base | Relative links |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub repo view | the repo root | work |
| PyPI project page | `https://pypi.org/project/vibey/` (the root README is the long description; this one is not rendered there) | **break** |
| Pages site | `https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey-skills/` | work only inside `docs/` |

- **Root Markdown** (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) must use **absolute** `https://github.com/…/blob/main/…` URLs —
  `blob` for files, `tree` for directories. 1.0.0 shipped
  `](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json)`, which renders fine on GitHub and 404s on PyPI.
- **Files under `docs/`** must use **relative** links so `mkdocs build --strict` can verify
  them and the Pages site stays self-contained.

`tools/check_links.py` enforces both directions and runs in CI. It is hermetic — no HTTP —
because a link checker that needs the network gets switched off the first time CI flakes.

## Documentation site

`mkdocs.yml` builds a Material site that CI validates with `mkdocs build --strict` (the
**Build docs (strict)** job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). The site actually published to
<https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey-skills/> is built separately, by
`.github/workflows/release-surfaces.yml`, from the near-identical `properdocs.yml` (via
ProperDocs, not mkdocs-material) after each successful `Release` run.

The skills reference is **generated**, not written: `docs/gen_reference.py` synthesises a page
per plugin and per skill from `plugins/**` at build time, exactly as the wheel maps that same
tree in via hatchling `force-include`. Never add a skill page to `docs/` by hand — edit the
`SKILL.md` it comes from. Adding a plugin or skill needs no `mkdocs.yml` change; the nav is
generated too.

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
mkdocs serve
mkdocs build --strict   # what CI runs; warnings are errors
```

`ci.yml`'s **Build docs (strict)** job runs on every push and pull request, so a skill
edit under `plugins/**` is validated even when nothing under `docs/` was touched.

## Scheduled currency research

`.github/workflows/currency-research.yml` runs weekly (Mondays, 06:17 UTC) and on
`workflow_dispatch`. It audits a rotating slice of the marketplace for stale dated claims —
versioned specifics, regulatory thresholds, market figures — researches them against the live
web, and opens a pull request against `develop` only when something actually changed. A run
that finds nothing writes its record to the job summary and opens nothing.

`tools/select_currency_batch.py` picks the slice. It is deterministic on the ISO week, so a
run reproduces locally:

```bash
python3 tools/select_currency_batch.py --week 34        # that week's briefing
python3 tools/select_currency_batch.py --plugins a,b    # an explicit set
```

**The method is not in the YAML.** It lives in the `currency-research` plugin in this
marketplace, which the workflow installs via the action's `plugin_marketplaces` / `plugins`
inputs — the repo's own deliverable tells the agent how to do the job, so improving the method
is an ordinary skill edit rather than a workflow change.

Two things must be configured for it to run, and neither is in the repository:

- the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repository secret — the job exits with a notice if it is absent
  rather than failing every week;
- Settings → Actions → General → **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**,
  without which the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot open the PR.

## Release tooling lives in a package, not in this repository

`vibey-gh` (a workspace tenant at `../gh`, no third-party dependencies) provides the
fingerprint check, the derived version bump, the merge train, and branch realignment. This repository used to carry its own copy
of all of that — `tools/check_fingerprints.py`, `tools/next_version.py`,
`tools/dev_version.py` and a 170-line merge-train workflow, about 530 lines. They are
gone; the behaviour is unchanged.

```bash
pip install -e ../gh      # from the tree; or `pip install vibey`, which carries it
vibey-gh install          # hooks + the merge-train workflow, and points core.hooksPath
vibey-gh check            # are the fingerprints intact?
vibey-gh version --since origin/main --explain
```

Everything project-specific is in `.vibey-gh.toml`: which files carry headers, which hold
the version, which paths count as content versus code, and who the merge train trusts.

`[install] workflows` manages `merge-train.yml`, `promote-to-main.yml`,
`provenance.yml`, `branch-intake.yml`, `automation-bootstrap.yml`, `codeql.yml`,
`pr-automation.yml`, `github-release.yml`, `repository-profile.yml`,
`conventional-commits.yml`, `release-repair.yml`, and `release-surfaces.yml`.
`provenance.yml`'s job is named **Provenance** and is a
REQUIRED status check on both rulesets — it replaced a hand-written "Check fingerprints"
step that used to live inside ci.yml's **Validate manifests and build** job.
`codeql.yml`'s job is named **Analyze Python** and is also a REQUIRED status check on
both rulesets, replacing CodeQL **default setup** (Settings -> Code security), which is
now switched off. Default setup scanned both the `python` and `actions` languages; the
template scans `python` only, so GitHub Actions workflow scanning has no coverage until
vibey-gh's template adds it. `pr-automation.yml` publishes **PR automation / gate**, also
a REQUIRED status check on both rulesets, configured with `[pr_automation]
scan_workflows = ["CI", "Provenance", "CodeQL"]` — the default additionally names
`"API drift (Cloud Agents OpenAPI)"` (vibey-gh's own self-test, not installed here) and
`"Docs"`.

**`"Docs"` is a real trap, hit and fixed in this repository**: the hand-authored `docs.yml`
(since retired — see below) was genuinely named `Docs`, but it only triggered on
`push: branches: [main]`, never on a pull request —
naming it in `scan_workflows` made `pr-automation.yml`'s `evaluate` job wait forever for a
scan that can never complete for a PR, `state` never left `pending`, and
**"PR automation / gate" never posted at all**. Made required on both rulesets, this
silently and permanently blocked every pull request, including the real `develop -> main`
promotion (#51), which had to be admin-merged to unblock production. `vibey-gh check`
(1.27.0+) now validates this itself via `check_scan_workflows()` and would have caught it
immediately: `pr_automation.scan_workflows names 'Docs' (.github/workflows/docs.yml),
which has no pull_request or pull_request_target trigger...`. `"Docs"` was removed from
`scan_workflows` here; the PR-time doc build this repository cares about is the
"Build docs (strict)" job inside `CI`, already in the list.

`github-release.yml` is installed and REQUIRED. Through vibey-gh 1.26.0 it failed on most
pushes to `main` — it had no way to skip a push that carried no version bump, and per
`[version]` above, most of this repository's own promotions are exactly that, docs- or
tooling-only. Fixed upstream in 1.27.0: that case is now a clean no-op
(`ReleaseResult(tag_created=False, release_created=False)`) rather than an error, gated
behind `[github_release] require_new_version` (left at its default `false`). Full history
in [.vibey-gh.toml](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey-skills/blob/main/.vibey-gh.toml)'s
`[install]` comment.
[.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey-skills/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml)
(hand-authored) still attaches build artifacts to whatever release this workflow
creates, since `vibey_gh.github_release.publish()` has no artifact-attachment capability
of its own.

`[pr_automation.fallback]` is **enabled** here. When the paid exact-head review returns no
verdict at all — an exhausted `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` being the usual cause — a local model on
a self-hosted runner (`vibey-local`) reviews the diff instead, so a billing problem stops
being a hard stop on every pull request. It never overrides a review that ran: the job
requires the primary to have produced no verdict, not merely to have failed. The verdict is
narrower than the primary's by design — constrained decoding guarantees the output shape,
not the judgments — so it assesses only what it can ground in the diff, and the gate titles
it `PR automation: gate (local fallback)`. `trusted_only` keeps fork pull requests off the
runner, which is what makes a self-hosted runner defensible on a public repository. The
runner must be up locally (`ollama serve` plus the supervisor); when it is not, the job
cannot be scheduled and behaviour degrades to what it was before.

`repository-profile.yml` is configured with a real `[repository_profile] description`
and `topics` — its defaults are generic release-automation boilerplate that would
overwrite this repository's actual GitHub description — and
`delete_branch_on_merge = false`, since `develop` heads the next promotion PR and must
survive a merge.

`conventional-commits.yml` had the same defect as `api-drift.yml` below through vibey-gh
1.16.0 — confirmed failing on PR #48 with "vibey-gh: command not found" inside the
msg-filter — fixed upstream in 1.27.0 (the same self-hosting detection `provenance.yml`
already used) and re-adopted here.

`release-repair.yml` is installed: it watches `CI`, `Provenance`, `Release`, `Release
surfaces`, and `GitHub Release` for post-merge failures on `develop`/`main` and spends an
AI call diagnosing and repairing each. It was excluded through vibey-gh 1.26.0 because
`github-release.yml` failed on every no-bump push to `main`, and each of those would have
been "repaired" as a real failure; 1.27.0 made that case a clean no-op (see above), so
there is no longer a recurring non-failure to chase, and it was re-adopted.

`release-surfaces.yml` is installed too, retiring the hand-authored `docs.yml` in the same
change — the two used to contest ownership of GitHub Pages, which is resolved by there
being only one publisher. It builds branch-specific ProperDocs sites (`properdocs build
--strict` against `properdocs.yml`, not `mkdocs build`) after each successful `Release`
run, plus an OCI release bundle in GitHub Packages. See `[documentation]` in
`.vibey-gh.toml` for the site's install requirements and GA4 id.

Not (yet) installed: `documentation.yml` — no narrative documentation contract
(`readme_sections`, `mermaid_terms`, etc.) is declared in `.vibey-gh.toml`, so none is
enforced.

`api-drift.yml` is excluded **permanently**: it does `pip install .` and imports
`vibey_gh.surfaces`, which only works when the adopting repository's own package *is*
`vibey-gh` — false here by design, since runtime `dependencies` are deliberately `[]`.
Confirmed unchanged in 1.27.0 and correctly scoped to a self-hosting repository, not a
bug.

`[install] pin_version = true` makes every rendered template pin its own `pip install` to
the exact version currently installing (`vibey==X.Y.Z` since vibey ADR-0037; `vibey-gh==X.Y.Z`
before it), rather than the unpinned install every template used through 1.16.0 — which is what let CI silently
jump from 1.2.0 to 1.16.0 and break on the new defaults in the first place (see below).
`vibey-gh install` is what advances the pin now; a hand-edit to any managed file is still
flagged "out of date" by `vibey-gh check` and reverted by the next `install`, so the pin
is the only durable way to control which version these workflows run. Bumping
`pyproject.toml`'s `[dev]` extra, then running `vibey-gh install` and re-verifying
`vibey-gh check --ci`, is how an upgrade is meant to happen — deliberately, as one
reviewed diff, never silently underneath a floating specifier.

## The fingerprint

**Every code change carries it. This is mandatory and CI enforces it.**

Made-With: Made with ❤️ by [Vibey](https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey/), Developed by [Adam Matthew Steinberger](https://vibewithadam.matthewsteinberger.com/) ([@adammatthewsteinberger](https://github.com/adammatthewsteinberger/)).
```

Two places, because a change can be either:

- **Source files** carry the header comment — `tools/`, `src/`, `docs/*.py` and
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`. `vibey-gh check --apply` adds it to anything missing it.
- **Every commit** carries the `Made-With:` trailer. This is what makes the rule total:
  a change to a `SKILL.md` or a JSON manifest still arrives as a commit, and the commit
  is fingerprinted even when the file cannot be.

Install the tooling and its hooks once per clone, so the trailer is added for you and a
push without the fingerprints is refused:

```bash
pip install -e ../gh      # from the tree; or `pip install vibey`, which carries it
vibey-gh install
```

`vibey-gh check` runs in CI on every push and pull request; on a pull request it also
checks the trailer on each commit the branch adds.

**What is deliberately not fingerprinted**, and why the trailer exists to cover it:

- `plugins/**/SKILL.md` — the product. Their bytes are loaded into a model's context and
  many are verified byte-for-byte against the source documents they were split from, so a
  header would be both context noise and a diff against the source.
- Any `.json` — no comment syntax, and `marketplace.json` is parsed by Claude Code itself.
- Prose Markdown at the root — documentation, rendered on PyPI and GitHub Pages.

## Branching and publishing

> **Superseded — this describes a process that no longer runs.** `vibey-skills` was
> published from its own repository with its own workflows. Since vibey ADR-0021 the
> source lives in the vibey monorepo, and since vibey ADR-0037 it is not published
> separately at all: the whole tree ships as `vibey`, released by the monorepo's own
> `release.yml`. The nested workflows under this directory are inert. The sections below
> are kept because they record how this package was released and why each gate existed —
> read the monorepo's `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the `vibey-releasing` skill for the process
> that is live.

```
feature/*  --PR-->  develop  --PR-->  main
                      |                 |
                   TestPyPI           PyPI
```

- **Work happens on `feature/*` branches**, never directly on `develop`. Open a pull
  request into `develop`.
- **Every push to `develop` publishes to TestPyPI** as `<release>.dev<run_number>` — see
  `vibey-gh version --dev`. An index version is immutable, so a develop build cannot reuse
  the release version; the dev suffix makes each push distinct and sorts it before the
  release it anticipates. The patch is applied in the runner only and never committed.
- **Every push to `main` publishes directly to PyPI** as the exact version in
  `src/vibey_skills/__init__.py`. Most pushes to
  main carry no version bump, so the publish skips a version PyPI already holds rather
  than failing.
- **A `v*` tag** additionally attaches the artifacts to a GitHub Release.

- **`feature/* -> develop` is squash-merged**, always and only. develop's ruleset sets
  `allowed_merge_methods: ["squash"]`, so a feature branch arrives on develop as one
  commit.
- **`develop -> main` is rebase-merged**, always and only. Every commit from develop is
  preserved and replayed onto the front of main's history with new SHAs and new
  timestamps. This is the only method consistent with the `required_linear_history` rule
  both rulesets enforce — a merge commit violates it, which is why merges to main used to
  need an admin bypass.
- **Two weekly trains** carry the work through, both on Monday, after the currency audit
  at 06:17:
  - `merge-train.yml` (07:17) reviews every open pull request into develop and
    squash-merges the ready ones. "Ready" is mechanical — not a draft, no conflicts,
    checks green, no changes requested; anything else is skipped with the reason recorded.
  - `promote-to-main.yml` (08:17) runs `vibey-gh promote`, which compares develop and
    main **by content** and, if they
    differ, opens the promotion pull request, waits for its checks and rebase-merges it.
    That push publishes to PyPI.
- **`develop` is realigned to `main`** by `vibey-gh realign`, in `release.yml`'s
  `sync-develop` job, after each
  publish. Rebase gives main rewritten SHAs, so develop can never be fast-forwarded onto
  it; the job realigns only when the two trees are **identical**, so it can never discard
  work. Do not realign by hand.

### Version bumps are derived, not remembered

`vibey-gh version` decides the release version from what actually changed since
`main`, and the promotion applies it:

| what changed | bump |
|---|---|
| `plugins/` or the marketplace manifest | **minor** — new or revised skills are the product |
| only `src/` | **patch** — a CLI fix |
| only docs, workflows, tooling | **none** — nothing reaches an installed user |
| version already differs from `main` | **none** — a deliberate bump is in place; never double-bump |

This has to be automatic. The PyPI upload uses `skip-existing`, so a promotion whose
version nobody bumped is a green run that publishes nothing, silently, with no warning.

### Why `develop` used to fall behind

A `develop -> main` pull request leaves exactly one commit on `main` that `develop` does
not have: the merge commit itself. GitHub's merge button has no fast-forward option, so
`develop` ended up permanently one commit behind after every release, every following
pull request reported *"head branch is not up to date"*, and the fix each time was a
manual back-merge.

The `sync-develop` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` removes that step: after a
successful publish from `main` it fast-forwards `develop` onto `main`. `develop`'s tip is
always an ancestor of the merge commit, so this is a fast-forward — no merge, no new
commit, nothing to resolve. **Do not back-merge `main` into `develop` by hand**; if the
job reports it could not fast-forward, that means `develop` has genuinely new commits and
they belong in a pull request.

## Releasing

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs both checkers, `uv build`, `uvx twine check dist/*`, a
wheel-completeness assertion, a wheel smoke test, and `mkdocs build --strict` on every push
and pull request.

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds once, publishes
directly to PyPI, and attaches the same sdist and wheel to a GitHub Release. Develop remains
the isolated TestPyPI lane and verifies its uniquely versioned development artifact there;
main and tags do not depend on a second registry.

Both publishes use Trusted Publishing (OIDC) — no API token is stored anywhere. Bump the
version in `src/vibey_skills/__init__.py` and `marketplace.json`'s
`metadata.version` together (CI asserts they match, and that the tag matches both), then tag.
