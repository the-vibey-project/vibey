"""mkdocs hooks.

Removes the literate-nav nav file from the built site.

`docs/gen_reference.py` writes `reference/.nav.md` through mkdocs-gen-files so the nav for
698 generated skill pages needs no mkdocs.yml edit. mkdocs-literate-nav consumes that file to
build the nav, but because gen-files adds it as a *virtual* page, mkdocs also renders it,
leaving an orphan page nothing links to.

Two documented approaches were tried and neither works for virtual files:

  * `exclude_docs: reference/.nav.md` — applies to real files in docs_dir; gen-files adds
    its pages afterwards, so the pattern never matches. Verified: orphan still built.
  * dot-prefixing the filename — mkdocs skips dot-prefixed files it discovers on disk, but
    not ones a plugin injects. Verified: `.nav.md` was rendered to `reference/.nav/`.

Deleting the rendered output after the build is therefore the reliable option, and it is
honest about what it does: the nav has already been constructed by then, so nothing depends
on the file still being present.
