# vibey-bootstrap

> **Now part of the vibey monorepo.** `vibey-bootstrap` lives in [the-vibey-project/vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) at [`src/vibey_tools/bootstrap`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_tools/bootstrap) (vibey ADR-0021). It is not published on its own any more: it ships inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution, so `pip install vibey` installs it (vibey ADR-0037).

> The cross-cutting layer for Azure Functions, FastAPI services, and AKS workers.
> One call bootstraps logging → App Configuration + Key Vault → Application Insights
> and hands you a populated `os.environ`. Everything past that (alerts, tracing,
> Service Bus, ten log transports, a scaffold CLI) is opt-in via pip extras.
> Used across 17+ Azure Functions repos at Vizius.

## Why

Every Azure app hits the same startup deadlock: you need logging to report
config loading, but App Insights logging needs config to initialize. Most repos
solve it with a copy-pasted `src/infrastructure/` folder that drifts. This
library is that folder, done once, tested, and versioned.

The **four-phase bootstrap** breaks the cycle:

1. **Console logging** — works immediately, before anything loads.
2. **Telemetry from env** — App Insights if `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is already set.
3. **Configuration** — Azure App Configuration + Key Vault references → `os.environ`.
   Local values (`local.settings.json`, your shell) always win; nothing is overwritten.
4. **Telemetry upgrade** — if the connection string only arrived via config, upgrade now.

Guarantees: the v1 API surface is preserved byte-identical across v2, v3, and v4
(v4 changes only the distribution and import name — see
[MIGRATING-TO-V4.md](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_tools/bootstrap/MIGRATING-TO-V4.md)); every
extra is opt-in and most are stdlib-only; log transports never block, never raise,
and use a bounded buffer. `USE_MOCK_BOOTSTRAP=true` runs everything without Azure.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install vibey      # vibey_bootstrap ships inside it (vibey ADR-0037)
```

```python
import os
from vibey_bootstrap import initialize_application, get_bootstrap_logger

logger = get_bootstrap_logger(__name__)   # usable before bootstrap completes
config_repo = initialize_application()     # runs all four phases

db_host = os.getenv("DATABASE_HOST")       # App Config + Key Vault values are in os.environ
```

Requires Python 3.11+. Falls back to plain environment variables when App
Configuration is not configured, so the same code runs locally and in Azure.

## Worked example: production-grade logging in four lines

```python
from vibey_bootstrap.alerts import install_global_exception_hooks, register_dispatcher
from vibey_bootstrap.bootstrap import ensure_bootstrap
from vibey_bootstrap.logging import configure_logging


def my_email_sender(recipients, subject, html_body):
    ...  # any callable with this signature (Graph, SendGrid, ACS)


configure_logging()
install_global_exception_hooks()
ensure_bootstrap()
register_dispatcher(my_email_sender, recipients=["dev-alerts@example.com"])
```

After this, every line emitted through stdlib `logging` carries a correlation
ID, extra fields render as greppable `key=repr(value)` pairs, noisy third-party
loggers are silenced, and uncaught exceptions fire CRITICAL alerts with dedup,
rate-limiting, and escalation. Runnable version:
[examples/01_quickstart.py](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_tools/bootstrap/examples/01_quickstart.py).

## What's in the box

| Layer | Install | You get |

| **v1 core** | `vibey-bootstrap` | Four-phase bootstrap, `EnhancedConfigRepository`, `TelemetryManager` |
| **v2 Tier 1** (always on, stdlib) | `vibey-bootstrap` | Structured logging, correlation IDs, masking, `@traced`, counters, error vocabulary, soft-fail, phases, validation, path safety, fail-close env helpers |
| **v2 Tier 2/3** (opt-in) | `[alerts]`, `[fastapi]`, `[servicebus]`, `[retry]`, … | Tiered alerts, FastAPI middleware, health probes, heartbeat, Service Bus consumer + DLQ, webhook auth, ingress hardening, HMAC tokens, AI usage tracker |
| **v3** (opt-in) | `[logging-all]`, `[db]`, `[email]`, `[http]`, `[aks]`, … | Ten log transports, SQLAlchemy + outbox, ACS email, hardened HTTP client, DocumentDB factory, AKS runtime helpers, governance, `vibey-bootstrap` scaffold CLI |

```bash
# On the vibey distribution the extras below are reached through two aggregates:
pip install 'vibey[azure]'           # the App Config / Key Vault / App Insights core
pip install 'vibey[bootstrap-all]'   # everything any extra below needs, in one
```

The full extras matrix (40+ extras, what each pulls in, when you need it) is in
the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_tools/bootstrap/docs/USAGE.md#1-installation--extras).

<details>
<summary>Feature inventory by release</summary>

**v2** — structured logging (`ExtraFieldsFormatter`, `correlation_scope`,
secret/email/control-char masking, noisy-logger silencing) · `@traced` with
latency histograms and slow-budget alerts · `alert_dev_team` with WARN / ERROR /
CRITICAL, dedup + rate-limit + escalation, `install_global_exception_hooks` ·

root confinement · Service Bus `handle_message` with dead-letter-vs-abandon
routing and `lock_for_process` · `install_graph_webhook_route` with validation

heartbeat + consumer watchdog, dynamic log-level refresh, DLQ digest with
HMAC-signed resubmit tokens, `/api/metrics` aggregator.

**v3** — ten logging transports (console, App Insights, Sumo Logic, Panther, file,
blob, SQL, NoSQL, ADX, Event Hubs; all share `_BufferedShipper` guarantees) ·

· hardened sync `requests` session + optional async `httpx` · Mongo/Cosmos client
factory from env · AKS `build_info`, SIGTERM handlers, leader-election stub ·
