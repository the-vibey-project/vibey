"""`vibey_bootstrap.gh` is an alias for the standalone `vibey-gh` package.

The implementation and its tests moved to that package. What still has to hold HERE is
the compatibility promise 4.1.0 made: every import that worked then works now, and
resolves to the same object rather than a copy — because a copy would mean patching one
and not the other, which is the subtlest way for a shim to be wrong.
