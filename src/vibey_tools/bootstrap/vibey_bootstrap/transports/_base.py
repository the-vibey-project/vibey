"""Internal buffered-shipper base for logging transports.

``_BufferedShipper`` is a ``logging.Handler`` base class that provides the
transport-agnostic machinery shared by every network/storage logging sink in
``vibey_bootstrap.transports``:

- **Never blocks** the calling thread — ``emit()`` only appends to an in-memory
  buffer; a daemon thread does the I/O.
- **Never raises** — every public method is wrapped; failures bump a counter and
  route through ``handleError``.
- **Bounded** — a ``deque(maxlen=…)`` drops the oldest record under sustained
  backpressure rather than growing without limit; drops are counted.
- **Flushes** on a configurable interval, when the buffer crosses ``batch_size``,
  when the buffer crosses ``max_batch_bytes``, and at process exit via ``atexit``.
- **Batches by bytes** — if ``max_batch_bytes`` is set, an in-progress batch is
  split before it crosses the limit (always ships at least one record per call).

Subclasses implement a single method::

    def _ship(self, batch: list[str]) -> ShipResult:
        ...

``_ship`` receives a list of already-formatted log lines (strings) and returns a
``ShipResult`` indicating success and record count.  It may raise; the base class
catches all exceptions, bumps ``{counter_prefix}.transport.error``, and continues.

``_BufferedShipper`` is **internal** (underscore-prefixed) and intentionally
absent from ``__all__``.  It is an implementation detail; application code never
imports it directly.

        Number of records successfully shipped (may be less than the batch size

    Parameters
    ----------
    counter_prefix:
        The dot-separated prefix for ``bump_counter`` keys, e.g. ``"panther"``.
        The base class bumps ``{prefix}.transport.{dropped,error,ok,records}``;
        subclasses may bump additional keys (e.g. ``throttled``, ``posts``).
    batch_size:
        Flush when the buffer contains this many records.  The background thread
        also flushes on ``flush_interval`` regardless.
    max_batch_bytes:
        If set (> 0), a single ``_ship`` call never exceeds this many encoded
        bytes.  The batch is split and ``_ship`` is called multiple times per
        drain cycle.  ``None`` disables byte-aware splitting.
    flush_interval:
        Seconds between background flushes.  The thread also wakes immediately
        when ``batch_size`` is reached.
    max_buffer:
        Maximum number of records held in memory.  When the buffer is full,
        the oldest record is silently evicted (``deque(maxlen=…)`` semantics)
        and the dropped counter is incremented.
