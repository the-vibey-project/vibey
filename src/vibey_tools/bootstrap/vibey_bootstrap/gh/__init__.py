"""Compatibility alias for the standalone `vibey-gh` package.

This subpackage shipped the GitHub automation in 4.1.0. In 4.2.0 the code moved to
`vibey_gh`, which has no dependencies, because release tooling runs in every CI job of
every repository that adopts it — and reaching it through this package meant installing
the Azure SDK and OpenTelemetry to run a stdlib CLI. Since ADR-0037 both ship inside the
one [vibey](https://pypi.org/project/vibey-engine/) distribution rather than as two, so the
import below never crosses a package boundary at all:

    from vibey_bootstrap.gh import merge_train          # the module
    from vibey_bootstrap.gh.config import GhConfig      # and its submodules

Both now resolve to the same objects `vibey_gh` exposes — not copies of them, so patching
one is patching the other. New code should import `vibey_gh` directly.
