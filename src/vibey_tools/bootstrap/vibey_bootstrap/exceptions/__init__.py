"""Project-neutral exception hierarchy for pipelined applications.

Distinct from :mod:`vibey_bootstrap.models.exceptions` (which carries the v1
``RepositoryError`` family for config-source failures). This module's tree
gives consumers an ``is_unrecoverable(exc)`` classifier so the Service Bus
consumer wrapper can route failures to dead-letter vs abandon without
hard-coding project-specific exception types.
