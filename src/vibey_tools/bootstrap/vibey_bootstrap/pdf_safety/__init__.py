"""PDF action stripping for untrusted pass-through.

When an app merges customer-uploaded PDFs into an output that will be
redistributed, the catalog-level OpenAction, AcroForm-field actions, page
actions, and annotation actions are an exfiltration / phishing risk if the
viewer renders them. This module strips them in-place before
``writer.append(reader)``.

Best-effort: any exception inside the scrub is caught and the original
reader passes through. Reason: a malformed PDF that crashes the scrubber
must not block report generation — the ingress gates already classified
it as a valid PDF.
