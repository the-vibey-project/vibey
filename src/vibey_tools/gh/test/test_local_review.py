    """A live false positive is the reason this rule exists.

    Reviewing qwenloop's release promotion, the local lane returned a BLOCKING finding:
    "The use of a specific API key in the `anthropic/claude-code-action` step could expose
    sensitive information." Every reference in that file is
    `anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}` — the standard secret reference,
    with no literal key material anywhere. The model saw the string `api_key` in a workflow
    and generalised.

    That cost a real release: the gate failed, and the failure had to be diagnosed and
    dispositioned by hand. The rule is narrow on purpose — it names specific correct idioms
    rather than telling the reviewer to relax about security, which would trade one failure
    mode for a worse one.
