"""Reconcile GitHub repository rulesets from `.vibey-gh.toml`.

`repository-profile.yml` reconciles description, topics, and collaboration settings, then
only *verifies* that the integration and release branches are protected — nothing ever set
that protection. This module is what sets it, using the same idempotent read-compare-write
shape that verification already trusts.

Building a desired ruleset and comparing it against a fetched one is pure and dependency
free, so that logic lives here with no I/O; the functions that talk to `gh` sit beside it,
exactly the split `vibey_gh.reconcile` already uses for branch reconciliation. A rule type
the configuration does not mention is never removed from an existing ruleset — it is
carried forward untouched and reported as unexpected, because a silent deletion of someone
else's rule is indistinguishable from data loss.
