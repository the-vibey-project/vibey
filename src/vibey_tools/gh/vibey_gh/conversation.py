"""Talking to the automation in the place the work already happens: a comment.

Everything else here is event-driven — a scan finishes, an issue opens, a branch moves.
None of it has a way to hear "also handle the empty case" written under a pull request.
This module gives it one: mention the configured trigger in a comment and the automation
reads the thread, answers, and — on a pull request, from someone trusted — makes the
change.

A comment is the least guarded input in a repository. Anyone with an account can write
one, on anything, at any time, so the same three rules that govern issue text govern this,
and one more that only conversation needs:

* **Replies are opt-in for strangers.** An outside commenter cannot start privileged work,
  and by default gets no response at all — a response costs tokens, so answering everyone
  is a spending decision a repository should make deliberately rather than inherit.
* **Comment text is data.** The thread is rendered into a bounded briefing and handed over
  as a report, never interpolated into a shell command or a prompt.
* **Changes are bounded.** Interactions per thread are budgeted, so a conversation cannot
  become an unbounded work queue.
* **It must never answer itself.** A bot that replies to its own replies is an infinite
  loop that spends real money, so its own identities are excluded before anything else is
  considered. This is the one failure mode unique to conversation, and the cheapest to get
  wrong.
