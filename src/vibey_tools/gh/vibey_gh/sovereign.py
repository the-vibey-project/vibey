"""Sovereign readiness (doctrine 8.a): is the free path actually able to take this?

Doctrine 8.a makes the 100% sovereign path the *preferred* way to run, not the
fallback of last resort. Acting on that safely needs one fact a workflow cannot
otherwise learn: whether a runner carrying the sovereign label is online **now**.

Without that fact the compliant-looking change is a trap, and it is worth naming
because it has already cost this project a production outage in another costume.
`review-sovereign` runs on a self-hosted runner. Disabled, the job *skips*, and a
skipped job counts as completed. Enabled with no runner online, it **queues** — not
failed, not cancelled, simply pending. The job that publishes the required
`PR automation / gate` check needs it and is guarded by `always()`, which waits for
needs to *complete*. So switching the sovereign lane on by default, with no probe,
blocks every pull request permanently and silently, with no red check to point at.

**Asking GitHub is not the answer**, and not only because it is unavailable: the
runners API needs `administration: read`, which `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be granted at
all. Depending on a privileged forge API to discover whether one's *own* machine is
up would also invert 8.a — it makes the sovereign lane's availability contingent on
a counterparty's capability, which is precisely what doctrine 10.a warns about.

So the machine says so itself, in the plainest artifact both sides already share: a
git ref. The operator's supervisor calls `beat()` on a timer, which pushes an empty
commit to a ref outside `refs/heads/` — no branch, nothing for doctrine 9.a's tidy
pass to find. Any job with ordinary `contents: read` fetches that ref and reads its
timestamp. Fresh means ready.

The failure direction is deliberate: anything unreadable, unparseable, or stale
reports **not ready**. A missing heartbeat costs a sovereign review; a false
positive costs every gate in the repository.

    because a heartbeat has no history worth keeping — only its most recent instant
    means anything.

    `--no-verify` is load-bearing, not a shortcut. A pre-push gate exists to judge code
    on its way off the machine, and this pushes an **empty tree with no parents** —
    there is no diff to lint, nothing to type-check, no dependency set to audit. Paying
    that gate anyway is not merely wasteful: measured against a real project whose
    pre-push stage runs the test suite, then a coverage pass that runs the suite a
    second time, then a network dependency audit, a heartbeat ran past two minutes
    without finishing, against **1.2 seconds** with the gate skipped. A timer that cannot
    finish inside its own interval is not a heartbeat, and in a loop over several
    repositories it stalls every repository queued behind it too.
