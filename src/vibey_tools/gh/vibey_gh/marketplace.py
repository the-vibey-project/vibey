"""One Claude Code marketplace at the repository root, rendered from the workspace members.

`/plugin marketplace add owner/repo` reads exactly one file: `<repo>/.claude-plugin/
marketplace.json`. A monorepo that absorbed its plugin marketplaces as workspace members
(vibey ADR-0021) keeps each member's manifest where that member's own package expects it,
which leaves the root with nothing for the shorthand to read. This module renders the root
manifest FROM the members' manifests — built at reconcile time, never hand-maintained,
never a second source of truth (the corpus-index pattern) — and `check` reports drift, so
the shorthand keeps working as members grow.

Three properties are load-bearing:

- **deterministic**: the same members always produce the same bytes;
- **contained**: every rewritten plugin source is a `./`-relative path inside the root,
  which is all Claude Code resolves — no `../`, no absolute paths, no backslashes;
- **a name of its own**: Claude Code registers one marketplace per name per user, and each
  member's package still ships its own manifest under its own name, so the root carries
  `[marketplace] name` rather than borrowing a member's.
