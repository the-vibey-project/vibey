"""Policy and durable state for event-driven pull-request automation.

The workflow is intentionally thin.  It gathers GitHub data, asks this module for a
decision, and dispatches an agent only for the explicit ``repair`` or ``review`` states.
That keeps stale-SHA rejection, trust, retry limits, and check classification testable.
