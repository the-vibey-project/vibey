"""Reconcile open topic branches after the integration branch is rewritten.

Realign converges the integration branch onto the release branch with a lease-protected
force update, because a rebase-merged release branch holds rewritten copies of the same
commits. That is correct and deliberate — but it strands every topic branch that was cut
from a commit the rewrite replaced. Such a branch still carries the old copy, so Git sees
the same change on two divergent lines and reports a conflict for work that is already
upstream. Nothing about that conflict is real, and no contributor caused it.

This module decides what to do about each stranded branch, and the decision turns on one
question: does the branch carry anything that is not already upstream? `git cherry`
answers it by patch identity rather than by SHA, which is exactly the distinction the
rewrite destroys.

* **Nothing unique** — the branch is now a pure duplicate of history that already landed.
  Its pull request is closed with an explanation and the branch is deleted.
* **Unique work, automation-owned** — rebased onto the new tip. Rebase drops the
  patch-identical commits on its own, leaving only the real work.
* **Unique work, anyone else's** — left exactly as it is. A human's in-progress branch is
  not this automation's to rewrite; it gets a comment explaining what happened instead.

A fork branch is never touched in any case, and no permanent branch can reach a mutating
path: `deletable` and `rebasable` both refuse them by name.
