    distribution that the same repository publishes.

    `config` changes the CONFIGURATION, never the root. A monorepo publishes several
    distributions from one tree, and one `.vibey-gh.toml` cannot express several version
    lines — but every path a config names (`[version] files`, `content_paths`,
    `code_paths`) is resolved against the repository root, and the version deriver asks
    git about them with `git show <rev>:<path>`, which only ever resolves from the top of
    the tree. So the alternate file lives beside the primary one and keeps writing
    repository-root-relative paths; pointing the root at a subdirectory instead would
    silently read the wrong pyproject.
