# vibey-gh

Shipping a change safely through review, merge, versioning, and release usually means
hand-wiring a dozen GitHub Actions steps — and they drift out of sync, silently skip a
check, or let a stale result approve code that has since changed. `vibey-gh` replaces
that hand-wired path with one event-driven, auditable contract: push a branch, and the
tooling carries it through review, repair, merge, release, and documentation on its own,
stopping only when a human decision is genuinely required.

**New to the project?** Begin at [Start here](start/index.md) — a zero-context
welcome, a guided first session, and a glossary bridge. Then [Adoption](adoption.md) — it assumes nothing and
walks one repository from bare to fully automated. The pages after it are the
engineering reference; the formal material ([Threat model](threat-model.md),
[Governance](governance.md), [Architecture decisions](adr/README.md)) comes last.

### Resolve

An eligible published issue becomes one guarded solution branch and a linked pull request,
without a human in between.

### Repair

Failed scans are diagnosed, repaired on a guarded branch, and sent back through the full
review path.

### Review

Outside contributions receive structured, current-head review before they enter the
merge train.

### Release

Develop and main move through distinct, reproducible TestPyPI, PyPI, Pages, Packages,
tagging, and GitHub Release channels.

## Start in two commands

```console
pip install vibey-engine
vibey-gh install
```

The installed runtime stays dependency-free. The generated workflows remain pinned,
auditable, and independently testable.
