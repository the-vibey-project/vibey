# claudeloop

> **Now part of the vibey monorepo.** `claudeloop` lives in [the-vibey-project/vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) at [`src/vibey_runners/claude`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude) (vibey ADR-0021). It is not published on its own any more: it ships inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution, so `pip install vibey` installs it (vibey ADR-0037).

**Onion-architected, autonomous Claude Code session runner and full Anthropic
SDK CLI** — never blocks on a human, distinguishes an exhausted rate-limit
window from exhausted credits, and resumes safely across usage windows.

## What problem this solves

Claude Code sessions hit usage limits. A `claude -p` invocation ending
doesn't tell you whether the *task* finished or just that *turn* did. And
when a rate limit rejects you, you can't tell from the outside whether
waiting will ever help — a five-hour window resets on its own; an exhausted
credits balance never will, no matter how long you wait.

`claudeloop` exists to get all three of those distinctions right,
automatically, so you can hand it a plan and walk away — including handling
the case where you top up your account's credits while it's mid-wait, which
it notices on the next probe rather than at some fixed deadline.

This project began as [`legacy/claude_autoresume.py`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/legacy/claude_autoresume.py),
a single-file script that did this by shelling out to `claude -p` and
regex-scraping its output. `claudeloop` replaces that with a tested,
typed, onion-architected package built on the official `claude-agent-sdk`.
See the [architecture decision records](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs/architecture/decisions/0001-onion-architecture-with-import-linter.md) for why
each specific change was made.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.12+**, **macOS or Linux**, and the
[Claude Code CLI](https://code.claude.com) installed and authenticated.
Windows is not a supported target.

```bash
pipx install vibey      # or: uv tool install vibey / pip install vibey
                        # the whole family; claudeloop is one of its console scripts
```

See the [installation guide](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs/getting-started/installation.md)
for requirements and a from-source setup.

## Quickstart

```bash
claudeloop doctor                # pre-flight checks before a long unattended run
claudeloop run handoff.md        # seed a session from a plan file and run to completion
claudeloop resume                # resume whatever you were last working on
claudeloop resume --session-id <id>
claudeloop api models list       # any Anthropic SDK endpoint (generated; see docs)

# Mid-run control (second terminal, same cwd):
claudeloop status
claudeloop snapshot              # handoff JSON under .claudeloop/runs/<id>/snapshots/
claudeloop logs -f --chatter
claudeloop prompt --now "Also cover the error path"
claudeloop preset high           # or: model / effort (low|medium|high|xhigh|max)
claudeloop permission-mode plan  # mid-run; default at start is always bypass
claudeloop attach ./notes.md
claudeloop response retry
claudeloop watch --stream        # Textual live stream; --replay for history
claudeloop stop                  # soft-stop → stop-summary.md (exit 130)
claudeloop savepoints
claudeloop unwind --to 1         # after stop; git save-point restore
```

## Why it's different from just retrying on 429

| | Naive retry | `claudeloop` |
|---|---|---|
| Sees an HTTP 429 | Sleeps a fixed duration, retries | Classifies *why* — a waitable rate-limit window, or exhausted credits that only a human can fix |
| Credits exhausted | Sleeps forever, no reset time exists | Probes on a bounded backoff and tells you it needs you |
| A credit top-up arrives mid-wait | Not noticed until the fixed sleep ends | Noticed on the next scheduled probe |
| Turn ends vs. task ends | No structured signal — a marker string, easily confused with a truncated limit message | Structured per-turn JSON verdict, with the legacy marker kept only as a fallback |
| Asked a clarifying question | Hangs waiting for stdin, or fabricates an answer | Denies the tool call with guidance, so the model proceeds on a stated, auditable assumption |

See [rate limits vs. credits](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs/guides/rate-limits-and-credits.md)
and [never blocking on a human](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs/guides/never-blocking.md) for the
full reasoning.

## Documentation

Full docs (MkDocs Material sources) live in the
[`docs/`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs) directory of the vibey monorepo, starting at
[`docs/index.md`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs/index.md). The standalone `claudeloop` Pages site has been retired.

## Project status

Pre-1.0, but functional through milestone **M5**. The CLI above genuinely
works — `run`/`resume` drive Claude Code through `claude-agent-sdk`,
`sessions` and `doctor` run against your environment, and **`claudeloop api`**
exposes a generated 1:1 Anthropic SDK REST surface with a CI drift gate.
`domain`/`application` carry a CI-enforced 100% test-coverage gate, with a
live test suite (`tests/live/`) exercising the installed console script.
`run` / `resume` log to stderr twice — a human-readable stream and a JSON
line stream — controlled by `--log-level`; see
[logging and observability](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/docs/guides/logging-and-observability.md).

## Security

This tool bypasses Claude Code's interactive permission prompts by design
(that's what makes autonomous operation possible) and handles API
credentials. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude/SECURITY.md) for the threat model and how
to report a vulnerability.

## Related projects

Same contract, different vendor. The four `*loop` runners share one domain
state machine, one set of application ports, and one `.<name>loop/runs/<id>/`
layout — pick the one that matches the agent you pay for:

| Runner | Drives | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **claudeloop** (this package) | Claude Code (Anthropic) | `claudeloop` |
| [codexloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex) | OpenAI Codex / GPT | `codexloop` |
| [cursorloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor) | Cursor Agent (Composer-first; Grok as a model profile) | `cursorloop` |
| [agyloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy) | Google Antigravity / Gemini | `agyloop` |

All four ship inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution: one
`pip install vibey` puts every command above on `PATH` (vibey ADR-0037).

Around them:

- [vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) — queue-based, six-phase conductor (spec interview → design → build → review → deploy) that drives these four runners as interchangeable engines, plus the local runner in [`src/vibey_runners/qwen`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/qwen) as a fifth: `gptossloop`, the sovereign default on GPT-OSS, and the opt-in `qwenloop` on Qwen (vibey ADR-0015, ADR-0064).
