# claudeloop

**Onion-architected, autonomous Claude Code session runner and full Anthropic
SDK CLI** — never blocks on a human, distinguishes an exhausted rate-limit
window from exhausted credits, and resumes safely across usage windows.

## What problem this solves

Claude Code sessions hit usage limits. A `claude -p` invocation ending
doesn't tell you whether the *task* finished or just that *turn* did. And
when a rate limit rejects you, you can't tell from the outside whether
waiting will ever help — a five-hour window will reset on its own; an
exhausted credits balance never will, no matter how long you wait.

`claudeloop` exists to get all three of those distinctions right,
automatically, so you can hand it a plan and walk away — including handling
the case where you top up your account's credits while it's mid-wait.

## Project status

Pre-1.0. Milestones **M1–M5 are complete** (pure domain core, autonomous
runner, resilient waiting, generated REST surface, polish). An **ops
control plane** on top of that core provides mid-run stop/prompt/logs,
model/effort, permissions/cwd, run-scoped resources (attachments, skills,
MCP), memories/artifacts, chat metadata, and response actions. See
[architecture overview](architecture/overview.md) for the living status;
historical plans under [`plans/`](plans/architecture-and-roadmap.md) are
preserved design records.

## Supported platforms

**macOS and Linux.** Python 3.10–3.13. Windows is not a supported target —
see [installation](getting-started/installation.md#requirements).
