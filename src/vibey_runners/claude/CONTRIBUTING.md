# Contributing to claudeloop

Thank you for considering a contribution. This document is meant to be
command-level and specific — if something here is unclear or you hit a
situation it doesn't cover, that's a bug in this document; please open an
issue or a PR fixing it.

## Environment setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey.git
cd vibey/src/vibey_runners/claude   # claudeloop lives here in the vibey monorepo
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
pre-commit install
```

Requires Python 3.10+ on **macOS or Linux**. Windows is not a supported
target — CI and classifiers are Unix-only; see
[`docs/getting-started/installation.md`](docs/getting-started/installation.md).
The GitHub default branch is **`develop`** (the integration branch you PR
into). `main` is the releasable line; releases are cut by vibey-gh in the vibey monorepo.

See [`docs/contributing/development.md`](docs/contributing/development.md) for
the full version of this page, including where new code belongs in the
onion architecture.

## The branch model (gitflow)

```
main         ← the vibey monorepo's release branch
  ▲ rebase merge — promotion PRs opened by `vibey-gh promote`
develop      ← the monorepo's integration branch; feature branches target this
  ▲ squash merge — one conventional-commit-titled squash per feature
feature/*    ← your work
```

This package is developed inside the [vibey monorepo](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey)
(`src/vibey_runners/claude`), and its branch model, merge train and release automation are the
monorepo's: see vibey's [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [ADR-0028](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/docs/architecture/decisions/0028-vibey-gh-owns-release-and-provenance.md).
release-please was retired; `vibey-gh` derives versions and publishes.

1. `git checkout -b feature/short-description develop` in the vibey repository.
2. Commit using [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits).
3. Open a PR **into `develop`**, not `main`. This package's own quality gates
   still apply and run in vibey's CI.
4. The merge train squash-merges the PR once its checks and review pass.
5. `vibey-gh promote` opens the promotion PR into `main`; it is rebase-merged
   and the release workflow publishes.

## Conventional Commits

Every commit message must follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Allowed types (enforced by the `commit-msg` hook in `--strict` mode — any
other type is rejected):

| Type | Use for | Version bump |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature | minor |
| `fix` | A bug fix | patch |
| `feat!` / `fix!` / a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | A breaking change | major |
| `docs` | Documentation only | none |
| `style` | Formatting, no logic change | none |
| `refactor` | Neither a fix nor a feature | none |
| `perf` | A performance improvement | patch |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests | none |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies | none |
| `ci` | CI configuration | none |
| `chore` | Anything else | none |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit | depends |

```
feat(domain): add CreditsExhausted as a distinct capacity state
fix(waiting): clamp exponential backoff before constructing timedelta
docs(architecture): add ADR for the retry-watchdog decision
```

The **scope** (`domain`, `waiting`, `loop`, `cli`, `docs`, ...) in
parentheses is optional but strongly encouraged — it makes the
history and the changelog dramatically more scannable.

## Git hooks

Installed with a single command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This wires up **both** hook types this repo uses — `pre-commit` (ruff lint
+ format, generic file hygiene, local mypy/bandit/import-linter checks) and
`commit-msg` (Conventional Commits enforcement) — because
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` declares `default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit,
commit-msg]`. You do not need `--hook-type commit-msg`; if you've seen that
flag suggested elsewhere, it isn't necessary here.

**Troubleshooting:**

- *"My commit was rejected with a Conventional Commits error"* — your
  editor still has the message you typed; fix the first line to match
  `<type>[scope]: <description>` using a type from the table above and
  commit again.
- *"A hook failed and modified files"* — ruff's `--fix` and `ruff-format`
  hooks can rewrite files in place. `git status`, review the changes,
  `git add` them, and commit again — this is expected pre-commit behavior,
  not a failure to work around.
- *"Hooks are slow the first time"* — pre-commit builds an isolated
  environment per hook repo on first run and caches it. Subsequent commits
  are fast.
- *"I need to bypass hooks for an emergency commit"* — `git commit
  --no-verify`. Use sparingly; CI will still enforce everything the hooks
  would have caught.

## Quality gates

Run the full set locally before opening a PR:

```bash
ruff check src tests
ruff format --check src tests
mypy src/claudeloop
pytest
lint-imports
bandit -q -r src/claudeloop
pip-audit
```

Or the subset wired into hooks, against your working tree:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Fixing common failures:**

| Gate | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ruff check` | Lint error | `ruff check --fix src tests` for auto-fixable ones; the rest need a manual edit |
| `ruff format --check` | Formatting diff | `ruff format src tests` |
| `mypy` | Type error | Add/correct type annotations. `domain/` and `application/` run under `--strict` — no `Any` escape hatches without a documented reason |
| `pytest` | A test fails or coverage drops below the per-package floor | See [Testing philosophy](#testing-philosophy) below |
| `lint-imports` | An onion-layering violation | See [The onion architecture import rule](#the-onion-architecture-import-rule) |
| `bandit` | A flagged security pattern | Either fix it, or — if it's a genuine false positive like an exhaustiveness `assert` — add a `# nosec B1xx` with an inline comment explaining *why* it's not a real issue (two examples already exist in `src/claudeloop/domain/loop.py`) |
| `pip-audit` | A dependency has a known CVE | Bump the dependency; if no fix is available yet, document the exposure and mitigation in the PR |

## Testing philosophy

Full detail: [`docs/contributing/testing.md`](docs/contributing/testing.md).
The short version:

- **Fakes over mocks.** Every port gets a real class implementing the same
  `Protocol`, checked by `mypy --strict` — not a `unittest.mock.Mock`.
- **No real sleeping, ever, in a test.** `FakeClock`/`FakeSleeper` let a
  simulated seven-day rate-limit wait, or a scripted credit-top-up sequence,
  run in microseconds.
- **Hypothesis property tests for anything numeric or time-based.** This
  already caught a real `timedelta` overflow bug in the backoff calculation
  during development — see
  [ADR 0004](docs/architecture/decisions/0004-adaptive-waiting-with-probes-not-sleep.md).
- **`domain/` and `application/` require 100% coverage.** These layers have
  zero I/O and zero third-party dependencies — there's no excuse for an
  untested branch, and this is precisely the code deciding whether an
  unattended run keeps going, waits, or gives up.
- **`# pragma: no cover` must carry a reason.** A bare pragma with no
  explanation will be rejected in review.

## The onion architecture import rule

`domain/` imports nothing but the standard library. `application/` imports
`domain/` and defines ports as `Protocol`, never a concrete SDK type.
`infrastructure/` is the *only* place `anthropic` or `claude_agent_sdk` may
appear in an `import` statement. `cli/` talks to `application/` use cases via
`bootstrap.py`, never to `infrastructure/` directly.

This is enforced by `import-linter` — running in CI and in the pre-commit
hooks — not by convention. If your PR needs to import across a layer
boundary this rule forbids, that's a signal the code belongs in a different
layer, not a signal to weaken the contract. See
[`docs/architecture/overview.md`](docs/architecture/overview.md) for the
full layer table and the "where does new code belong" decision test, and
[ADR 0001](docs/architecture/decisions/0001-onion-architecture-with-import-linter.md)
for why this was chosen over convention-only layering.

## PR checklist

- [ ] Branch created from `develop`, named `feature/<short-description>`
- [ ] Commits (or at minimum the squash-merge title) follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes
- [ ] `pytest` passes with coverage gates met (100% on any `domain`/`application` code touched)
- [ ] New numeric or time-based logic has a Hypothesis property test, not just examples
- [ ] No new cross-layer imports that `lint-imports` would reject
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior changed — including removing a `!!! note "Roadmap"` admonition if this PR implements something previously marked as roadmap
- [ ] A new ADR added under `docs/architecture/decisions/` if this PR makes a hard, non-obvious design call worth preserving the reasoning for
