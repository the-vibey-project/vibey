"""LEGACY REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION — not part of the `claudeloop` package.

This is the original single-file script `claudeloop` is replacing. It is kept
here, unmodified in behavior, because it is the source of truth for every
behavioral requirement the new implementation must satisfy or deliberately
improve on (see docs/architecture/decisions/ for the specific supersessions:
structured rate-limit signals replacing the regex scraping below, the
credits-vs-window distinction, list_sessions() replacing the glob-based
session discovery, etc.). Do not add new features here — extend
`src/claudeloop/` instead. This file may be deleted once `claudeloop` reaches
feature parity (milestone M2) and the team is confident nothing here was
missed.

Original docstring follows.
---

Runs `claude` and automatically resumes whenever it stops because a
usage limit was hit. Two ways to point it at work:

    python3 claude_autoresume.py handoff.md
        Starts a brand-new session seeded with the contents of handoff.md,
        then auto-resumes that session (via `claude --continue`) every time
        it gets cut off by a limit.

    python3 claude_autoresume.py --session-id <id>
        Resumes an existing session by its Claude Code session id (via
        `claude --resume <id>`) instead of starting fresh from a prompt
        file. Use this to pick up a session you (or another invocation of
        this script) already started elsewhere.

    python3 claude_autoresume.py
        Neither given: auto-detects the most recently modified Claude Code
        session for the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY (by reading
        ~/.claude/projects/<sanitized-cwd>/*.jsonl) and resumes that one.
        Prints a loud, impossible-to-miss warning banner showing exactly
        which session it picked (id, transcript path, last-activity time,
        git branch, first-prompt preview) before doing anything, so you can
        Ctrl-C if it grabbed the wrong one. If no session exists for this
        directory, it errors out immediately rather than guessing further.

Passing BOTH a prompt-file and --session-id is ambiguous and is an error.

Run this from whatever working directory you want `claude` to operate in
(e.g. your project's repo root) -- that's the directory the session and any
file edits happen in, and (in the no-argument form) the directory whose
most recent session gets auto-selected.

How it works:
- Before doing any real work, runs a cheap preflight ping (a trivial
  "reply with the word OK" prompt against the same session) to check
  whether you're *already* in a limit cooldown right now -- e.g. because
  you (or a prior run of this script) hit the limit before launching this
  invocation. If so, it waits out the cooldown before spending a real
  attempt. If there's no prior session to resume yet (fresh prompt-file
  start with no existing session), the preflight just no-ops and the
  script proceeds straight to the real first run.
- Real attempts: first run (prompt-file mode only) seeds a fresh session
  with the file's contents; every attempt after that -- including the
  very first one in --session-id mode -- resumes via --continue or
  --resume <id>.
- Streams a readable one-line-per-event summary to your terminal as it
  works (assistant text, tool calls, final result), while writing the full
  raw JSON stream to a log file so nothing is lost. This is headless `-p`
  mode, not the interactive UI, so it won't look identical to running
  `claude` directly in a terminal -- but you do see live progress instead
  of silence until the end.
- When a real attempt's process exits, decides whether a hard usage/session
  limit was hit by inspecting structured stream-json signals (rate_limit_event
  status:rejected, error:rate_limit, api_error_status:429) and limit phrasing
  in the final result / API-error message only -- NOT the whole stream (which
  often contains allowed_warning events with a weekly resetsAt, and repo docs
  that mention "rate limit"). If limited, sleeps until the rejected event's
  resetsAt or a parsed "resets 5pm"-style time; otherwise falls back to
  --wait-minutes (default 60) and retries.
- A single `claude -p` invocation is one turn: it can end because the
  overall task is genuinely finished, OR just because that turn's response
  ended (ran out of steps, paused, whatever) while multi-part work
  (E19-E26, say) remains. The two look identical from the outside -- exit
  code 0, no limit language -- so every prompt sent (the initial one, and
  --continue-prompt) has a completion-marker instruction appended at
  runtime: "if the entire task is done, end your final message with
  <marker>; if not, don't." Only seeing that exact marker in the output
  means "stop looping". Exit 0 with no limit language and no marker means
  "that turn ended but the task isn't done" -- the script immediately
  fires another --continue attempt (no cooldown wait, since this isn't a
  limit) and keeps going. Override the marker with --done-marker if it
  collides with something in your own prompt.
- If a real attempt exits with an error that ISN'T limit-related, the
  script stops and prints the error rather than retrying blindly (so a
  real bug doesn't get silently retried forever).
