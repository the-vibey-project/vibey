"""Regression tests for --cwd isolation across all subcommands.

These tests verify that commands respect --cwd and never write to Path.cwd()
when an explicit --cwd is passed. The pattern: create a canary file in the
process cwd, run a command with --cwd pointing elsewhere, and assert the canary
is unchanged.

This prevents the exact incident that prompted this feature: a `resume` from
the wrong directory auto-committed work into the live checkout.
