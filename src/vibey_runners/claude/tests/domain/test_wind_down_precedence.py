"""Wind-down precedence: what a *predicted* stop must never beat.

The whole safety argument for adding a predictive branch to a mature state
machine is that it sits last. Each test below pins one rung of that order, so
a future reordering fails loudly rather than silently turning a completed run
into a handoff.
