"""Data transfer objects passed between application/ and adapters.

Not domain value objects — these carry the raw shape of one agent turn
before domain.classify.classify() and domain.completion.evaluate() reduce
them to CapacityState / CompletionVerdict. ``cost_usd is None`` means
UNKNOWN, never zero; ``cost_pending`` is propagated from the usage reader.
