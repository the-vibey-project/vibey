"""Forecasting how much capacity is left, so a run can stop *before* it runs out.

The existing capacity states answer "am I blocked right now?". By the time one
says yes it is too late to hand off cleanly: the snapshot, the stop summary and
the final save point all need capacity to produce. This module answers the
earlier question -- "am I about to be blocked?" -- so the wind-down happens
while there is still room to do it properly.

Pure. Five laws hold regardless of vendor, each one a test:

F1  Unknown is never exhausted. A missing vendor field must not stop a run.
    This is the counterpart of "a credits balance has no clock": we do not
    invent a number we were not given.
F2  Stale degrades to unknown, not to stale. Utilization arrives on an event;
    between events it is a lie, so past `max_staleness` it becomes unknown.
F3  Never before the first completed turn. Otherwise a run that starts at 90%
    utilization hands off an empty brief, and engines pass nothing to each
    other forever.
F4  Monotone. Lowering any headroom can never turn a wind-down back off.
F5  The binding dimension is the minimum *known* one -- never the minimum
    including unknowns.
