# cursorloop

> **Now part of the vibey monorepo.** `cursorloop` lives in [the-vibey-project/vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) at [`src/vibey_runners/cursor`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor) (vibey ADR-0021). It is not published on its own any more: it ships inside the [`vibey-engine`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey-engine/) package, so `pip install vibey-engine` installs it (vibey ADR-0037).

**Onion-architected, autonomous Cursor Agent session runner** — Composer-first
(`composer-2.5`; Grok is a secondary model profile, not a product). Never
blocks on a human, distinguishes a waitable rate-limit window from
non-waitable exhausted credits, and resumes safely across usage windows.

## What problem this solves

Cursor Agent sessions hit usage limits. A single agent turn ending doesn't
tell you whether the *task* finished or just that *turn* did. And when
Cursor rejects you, you can't tell from the outside whether waiting will
ever help — a rate-limit window resets on its own; an exhausted credits
balance never will, no matter how long you wait. Cursor does not publish a
stable credits discriminator on its `RateLimitError`, so cursorloop keeps a
configurable billing lexicon and, when a signal is ambiguous, **biases toward
`CreditsExhausted`** — the failure mode is a spurious "top up" notification,
never a hang past a fabricated reset.

`cursorloop` exists to get all three of those distinctions right,
automatically, so you can hand it a plan and walk away.

It is a deliberate transplant of the [claudeloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude)
design — same state machine, same ports, same run-directory layout —
retargeted onto the Cursor Agent SDK (`cursor-sdk`). There is **no Anthropic
dependency** and no foreign vendor auth env fallback.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.12+**, **macOS or Linux**, and a Cursor account with
`CURSOR_API_KEY` set for live runs. Windows is not a supported target.

```bash
pipx install vibey-engine      # or: uv tool install vibey-engine / pip install vibey-engine
                        # the whole family; cursorloop is one of its console scripts
cursorloop doctor            # --offline skips the live me / models calls
```

See the [installation guide](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor/docs/getting-started/installation.md)
for a from-source setup.

## Quickstart

```bash
cursorloop doctor                          # fail-fast preflight before a multi-hour unattended run
cursorloop run --plan plan.md              # seed a Cursor Agent from a plan and run to completion
cursorloop resume --agent-id <id>          # continue an existing agent
cursorloop models                          # composer-fast → composer → grok-4.5 → grok → grok-xhigh, plus router-* aliases
cursorloop agents                          # local agents for a workspace (needs a live client)
cursorloop whoami                          # authenticated Cursor account

# Mid-run control (second terminal, same cwd):
cursorloop status
cursorloop logs
cursorloop prompt "Also cover the error path"   # queued for the next turn
cursorloop watch                                # plain-text tail; --ui opens the Textual view
cursorloop hooks status                         # install | restore | diff the autonomy fragment
cursorloop stop                                 # soft stop
cursorloop wind-down                            # finish the turn, write a handoff marker, exit 75
cursorloop savepoints
cursorloop unwind --to <sha-or-ref>
cursorloop reset                                # restore managed hooks after a crashed run
```

`cursorloop cloud me|models|create|get|cancel` is a **partial** Cloud Agents
REST surface ([ADR-0006](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor/docs/architecture/decisions/0006-cloud-agents-rest-surface.md));
full generation waits on a digest-stable published OpenAPI document.

## Why it's different from just retrying on 429

| | Naive retry | `cursorloop` |
|---|---|---|
| Sees a rate-limit error | Sleeps a fixed duration, retries | Classifies *why* — a waitable window (bounded probe under `--max-wait`) or exhausted credits that only a human can fix; ambiguity resolves toward credits ([ADR-0005](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor/docs/architecture/decisions/0005-ambiguity-biases-credits.md)) |
| Credits exhausted | Sleeps forever, no reset time exists | `CreditsExhausted` has no `resets_at`. Probes on a bounded backoff and tells you it needs you |
| Vendor changes an error string | Silent misclassification | Configurable billing lexicon; unmatched terminal errors land in the audit log; `doctor --explain-error <payload>` classifies them offline ([ADR-0004](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor/docs/architecture/decisions/0004-billing-lexicon-configurable.md)) |
| Turn ends vs. task ends | A marker string, easily confused with a truncated limit message | Four-tier verdict: a `cursorloop-verdict` fenced block, done marker (`CURSORLOOP_TASK_FULLY_COMPLETE`), empty-turn soft-fail, plan-checkbox reconciliation. A capacity rejection outranks any completion claim |
| Agent asks a question | Hangs — Cursor has no `can_use_tool` callback | Managed `.cursor/hooks.json` autonomy fragment + preamble + `local.force` + a stall watchdog. Hooks are hash-verified and restored afterward; a mid-run user edit wins ([ADR-0008](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor/docs/architecture/decisions/0008-hash-verified-hooks-restore.md)) |

## Project status

Pre-1.0, but functional through the M5 milestone: Typer CLI (`run` /
`resume` / `doctor` / mid-run control), bootstrap that auto-launches
`CursorClient.launch_bridge`, a full offline-capable doctor checklist, a
deterministic `pytest -m system` harness (scripted agent, no Cursor account),
a partial-but-live Cloud Agents surface, a CLI-fallback gateway, and mirrored
agent skills. Later releases added the `-v`/`-q` verbosity ladder, `--run-id`,
wind-down, and capacity forecasting (measurement only, off by default).
Coverage floor is **100%** on every layer — domain, application,
infrastructure, and CLI.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Env prefix | `CURSORLOOP_*` |
| Auth | `CURSOR_API_KEY` (never an `ANTHROPIC_*` fallback) |
| State dir | `.cursorloop/runs/<run_id>/` |
| Done marker | `CURSORLOOP_TASK_FULLY_COMPLETE` |
| Model ladder | `composer-fast → composer → grok-4.5 → grok → grok-xhigh` (or `router-cost → router-balanced → router-intelligence`); default `composer-2.5` |
| Test-agent gate | `CURSORLOOP_ALLOW_TEST_AGENT=1` **and** `CURSORLOOP_TEST_AGENT_SCRIPT=<path>` |

## Security

This tool merges an autonomy fragment into `.cursor/hooks.json` for the
duration of a run (restored afterward, hash-verified), edits the working tree
without waiting on a human, and handles `CURSOR_API_KEY`. See
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor/SECURITY.md)
for the threat model and how to report a vulnerability.

## Related projects

Same contract, different vendor. The four `*loop` runners share one domain
state machine, one set of application ports, and one `.<name>loop/runs/<id>/`
layout — pick the one that matches the agent you pay for:

| Runner | Drives | Command |
|---|---|---|
| [claudeloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude) | Claude Code (Anthropic) | `claudeloop` |
| [codexloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex) | OpenAI Codex / GPT | `codexloop` |
| **cursorloop** (this package) | Cursor Agent (Composer-first; Grok as a model profile) | `cursorloop` |
| [agyloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy) | Google Antigravity / Gemini | `agyloop` |

All four ship inside the [`vibey-engine`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey-engine/) package: one
`pip install vibey-engine` puts every command above on `PATH` (vibey ADR-0037).
