# agyloop

**Onion-architected, autonomous Google Antigravity / Gemini session runner** —
never blocks on a human, and never treats billing or daily-quota exhaustion as
a short waitable RPM blip.

## What problem this solves

Antigravity / Gemini sessions hit usage limits. A single turn ending does not
tell you whether the *task* finished. A `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` does not tell
you whether waiting will help: an RPM window resets; an RPD window waits until
the next Pacific midnight; a spend / credits cap never grows a reset timestamp.

`agyloop` exists to get those distinctions right, automatically, so you can
hand it a plan and walk away.

## Project status

Public **0.2.0**, shipped inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey-engine/)
distribution — `pip install vibey-engine` (vibey ADR-0037).
The core loop, resilient waiting, CLI gateway, git savepoints, generated
Developer REST CLI, and this documentation site ship in that release.
