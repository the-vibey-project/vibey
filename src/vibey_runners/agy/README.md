# agyloop

> **Now part of the vibey monorepo.** `agyloop` lives in [the-vibey-project/vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) at [`src/vibey_runners/agy`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy) (vibey ADR-0021). It is not published on its own any more: it ships inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution, so `pip install vibey` installs it (vibey ADR-0037).

**Onion-architected, autonomous Google Antigravity / Gemini session runner
and generated Gemini REST CLI** — never blocks on a human, never treats
billing or daily-quota exhaustion as a short waitable RPM blip, and resumes
safely across usage windows.

## What problem this solves

Antigravity / Gemini sessions hit usage limits. A single turn ending doesn't
tell you whether the *task* finished or just that *turn* did. And a
`429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` doesn't tell you whether waiting will help: an
RPM / TPM window resets in a minute; an RPD window waits until the next
Pacific midnight; a spend cap or exhausted credits never grows a reset
timestamp, no matter how long you wait.

`agyloop` exists to get all of those distinctions right, automatically, so
you can hand it a plan and walk away — including noticing a top-up on the
next probe rather than at some fixed deadline.

It is a deliberate transplant of the [claudeloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude)
design — same state machine, same ports, same run-directory layout —
retargeted onto the `google-antigravity` SDK, with a live `agy` CLI as an
optional second gateway. There is **no Anthropic dependency**.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.12+** and **macOS or Linux**. Auth is **either**
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini Developer API) **or** Application Default
Credentials with a Vertex / Enterprise flag — `agyloop doctor` reports which
lane is active; it never guesses
([ADR 0011](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/architecture/decisions/0011-doctor-never-guesses-auth-lane.md)).
Windows is not a supported target.

```bash
pipx install vibey      # or: uv tool install vibey / pip install vibey
                        # the whole family; agyloop is one of its console scripts
agyloop doctor
```

See the [installation guide](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/getting-started/installation.md)
for a from-source setup and the TestPyPI dry-run.

## Quickstart

```bash
agyloop doctor                  # pre-flight: auth lane, no interactive hooks
agyloop run handoff.md          # seed a session from a plan and run unattended
agyloop resume --last           # resume the most recent .agyloop/ run
agyloop resume --conversation <id>
agyloop sessions                # local .agyloop/runs registry only
agyloop api --help              # any Gemini REST endpoint (generated; --lane vertex for the Vertex subset)

# Mid-run control (second terminal, same cwd):
agyloop status
agyloop logs
agyloop prompt --now "Also cover the error path"   # or --at-break
agyloop preset high             # low | medium | high (model + effort)
agyloop model medium            # alias or raw Gemini model id
agyloop attach ./notes.md
agyloop watch --stream          # Textual token stream; --replay for history
agyloop snapshot
agyloop stop                    # soft-stop the active run
agyloop savepoints
agyloop unwind --to 1           # git save-point restore (refuses while a run is active)
```

Pace cold Enterprise runs with `--ramp N`. Drive a live `agy` binary with
`--gateway cli`. Bound a run with `--max-turns`, `--max-wait`, `--max-tokens`
or a labeled `--max-dollars` estimate
([ADR 0009](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/architecture/decisions/0009-budgets-are-token-denominated.md)).

## Why it's different from just retrying on 429

| | Naive retry | `agyloop` |
|---|---|---|
| Sees `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Sleeps a fixed duration, retries | Classifies *which* exhaustion: RPM / TPM / IPM window (short probe cadence), RPD window (next Pacific midnight, not a short sleep), credits / spend / billing cap (no clock reset — probe until a human tops up), or auth failure (abort) |
| Credits exhausted | Sleeps forever, no reset time exists | `CreditsExhausted` has no `resets_at`. Probes on a bounded backoff and tells you it needs you |
| Daily quota | Guesses a sleep, or hammers a dead window | `--no-probe` waits only to computed quota boundaries and issues zero probe requests |
| Turn ends vs. task ends | A marker string, easily confused with a truncated limit message | Structured completion via Antigravity, done marker (`AGYLOOP_TASK_FULLY_COMPLETE`) as fallback. A capacity rejection always outranks a completion claim |
| Model asks a clarifying question | Hangs waiting on stdin, or fabricates an answer | `ask_question` is denied with guidance so the model proceeds on a stated, auditable assumption; interactive SDK hooks are never registered ([ADR 0007](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/architecture/decisions/0007-deny-ask-question-with-guidance.md)) |
| Sandbox vs. skip-permissions | `--sandbox --dangerously-skip-permissions` silently neuters the sandbox | Never emitted together; `--unsafe-skip-permissions` is a CLI-adapter-only opt-in that refuses root and non-git cwds ([ADR 0008](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/architecture/decisions/0008-never-skip-permissions-with-sandbox.md), [antigravity-cli#36](https://github.com/google-antigravity/antigravity-cli/issues/36)) |

and [never blocking on a human](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/guides/never-blocking.md)

## Project status

Pre-1.0, but functional through milestone **M5**: pure domain core,
autonomous runner, adaptive waiting for Gemini quotas, `agy` CLI gateway,
git savepoints, ops CLI, and a generated Developer + Vertex REST CLI with a
drift gate ([ADR 0015](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/docs/architecture/decisions/0015-generated-gemini-rest-with-drift-gate.md)).
Coverage floor is **100%** on every layer — domain, application,
infrastructure, and CLI. `pytest -m system` runs a scripted agent against
real FS / git / control with no Google account.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Env prefix | `AGYLOOP_*` |
| Auth | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` **or** ADC + Vertex / Enterprise flag |
| State dir | `.agyloop/runs/<run_id>/` |
| Done marker | `AGYLOOP_TASK_FULLY_COMPLETE` |
| Effort levels | `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`; presets `low` / `medium` / `high` map to `gemini-flash-lite-latest` / `gemini-2.5-flash` / `gemini-2.5-pro` |

## Security

This tool grants tool autonomy by default (`allow_all()` + workspace scope +
destructive-command denies; `--safe` narrows, `--yolo` widens), never
registers interactive SDK hooks, and handles Google credentials. See
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy/SECURITY.md)
for the threat model, the sandbox + skip-permissions footgun, and how to
report a vulnerability.

## Related projects

Same contract, different vendor. The four `*loop` runners share one domain
state machine, one set of application ports, and one `.<name>loop/runs/<id>/`
layout — pick the one that matches the agent you pay for:

| Runner | Drives | Command |
|---|---|---|
| [claudeloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude) | Claude Code (Anthropic) | `claudeloop` |
| [codexloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex) | OpenAI Codex / GPT | `codexloop` |
| [cursorloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor) | Cursor Agent (Composer-first; Grok as a model profile) | `cursorloop` |
| **agyloop** (this package) | Google Antigravity / Gemini | `agyloop` |

All four ship inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution: one
`pip install vibey` puts every command above on `PATH` (vibey ADR-0037).

- [vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) — queue-based, six-phase conductor (spec interview → design → build → review → deploy) that drives these four runners as interchangeable engines, plus the local runner in [`src/vibey_runners/qwen`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/qwen) as a fifth: `gptossloop`, the sovereign default on GPT-OSS, and the opt-in `qwenloop` on Qwen (vibey ADR-0015, ADR-0061).
