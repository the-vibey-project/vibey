"""Storm-mode plan text: one repo's open backlog turned into one qwenloop plan.

Ports the plan built by the `qwenstorm.sh` bash prototype: clear every open issue and PR
first, then write an academic paper, then build a comprehensive book, each gated on the
repo not already having one.

    An empty list (the fetch succeeded; there is simply nothing open) renders as nothing,

    results without ever reaching its `|| echo` fallback.

    The return value always either is empty or ends with its own trailing newline, exactly
    like the bash script's per-item jq output and its `echo` fallback both did — so the
    caller can join sections with a single separating "\n" and get one blank line between
    them regardless of which case applies.
