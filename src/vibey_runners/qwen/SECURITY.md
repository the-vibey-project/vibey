# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Use the repository's
[private security advisory form](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/security/advisories/new).

Include the affected version, backend, operating system, reproduction, impact,
and suggested mitigation. Remove credentials, private source code, prompts, and
model outputs that contain sensitive material.

## Security boundaries

Qwenloop treats model output, repository content, tool output, and retrieved
content as untrusted. Model servers bind to loopback and use per-launch bearer
credentials. Filesystem writes remain inside the assigned worktree, and model
weights are installed only after an explicit operator command.

A `shell` tool call runs with an allow-listed environment (`ShellEnvironment` in
`src/qwenloop/infrastructure/tools.py`). It gets the system basics only: `PATH`, `HOME`,
the user, the temp directory, locale, terminal, CA bundle, proxy and `XDG_*`. It never
gets vibey's `VIBEY_*` variables, libpq's `PG*`, or any name containing `KEY`, `TOKEN`,
`SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, `PASSWD`, `CREDENTIAL`, `DSN` or `DATABASE_URL`, whoever declares it.
