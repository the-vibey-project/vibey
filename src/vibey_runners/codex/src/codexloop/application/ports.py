"""Backwards-compatible re-export of `application.interfaces`.

The Protocols moved into `application/interfaces/` so every seam lives in
one discoverable place, one module per collaborator family. This shim keeps
the old `from codexloop.application.ports import X` path working; new code
should import from `codexloop.application.interfaces`.
