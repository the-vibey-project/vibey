# Contributing to codexloop

Thank you for considering a contribution. This document is meant to be
command-level and specific — if something here is unclear or you hit a
situation it doesn't cover, that's a bug in this document; please open an
issue or a PR fixing it.

## Environment setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey.git
cd vibey/src/vibey_runners/codex   # codexloop lives here in the vibey monorepo
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
pre-commit install
```

Requires **Python 3.12+** on **macOS or Linux**. Windows is not a supported
target. Live runs need the `codex` CLI on `PATH` and either `codex login` or
`OPENAI_API_KEY`; the default test suite needs neither.

## The branch model (gitflow)

```
main         ← the vibey monorepo's release branch
  ▲ rebase merge — promotion PRs opened by `vibey-gh promote`
develop      ← the monorepo's integration branch; feature branches target this
  ▲ squash merge — one conventional-commit-titled squash per feature
feature/*    ← your work
```

This package is developed inside the [vibey monorepo](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey)
(`src/vibey_runners/codex`), and its branch model, merge train and release automation are the
monorepo's: see vibey's [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [ADR-0028](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/docs/architecture/decisions/0028-vibey-gh-owns-release-and-provenance.md).
release-please was retired; `vibey-gh` derives versions and publishes.

1. `git checkout -b feature/short-description develop` in the vibey repository.
2. Commit using [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits).
3. Open a PR **into `develop`**, not `main`. This package's own quality gates
   still apply and run in vibey's CI.
4. The merge train squash-merges the PR once its checks and review pass.
5. `vibey-gh promote` opens the promotion PR into `main`; it is rebase-merged
   and the release workflow publishes.

Never implement on `main`.

## Conventional Commits

Every commit message must follow
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

Allowed types (enforced by the `commit-msg` hook in `--strict` mode):
`feat` (minor bump), `fix` / `perf` (patch), `feat!` / `fix!` / a
`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (major), and `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`,
`build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert` (no bump).

```
feat(domain): add usage_not_included to the quota code set
fix(argv): never emit --full-auto
docs(architecture): add ADR for the optional app-server transport
```

## Git hooks

`pre-commit install` wires up **both** `pre-commit` (ruff lint + format,
mypy, bandit, import-linter) and `commit-msg` (Conventional Commits) because
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` declares
`default_install_hook_types: [pre-commit, commit-msg]`.

- Conventional Commits rejection — fix the first line to
  `<type>[scope]: <description>` and commit again.
- A hook rewrote files — `git add` the fixes and commit again.
- Emergency bypass: `git commit --no-verify`. CI still enforces the gates.

## Quality gates

Run the full set locally before opening a PR:

```bash
ruff check src tests
ruff format --check src tests
mypy --strict src/codexloop
pytest                         # default: not live and not system
pytest -m system               # scripted system harness; no OpenAI account
pytest -m live                 # real Codex account (opt-in)
lint-imports
bandit -q -r src/codexloop
pip-audit
mkdocs build --strict
```

Or the subset wired into hooks: `pre-commit run --all-files`.

Coverage floor: **100% for the whole package**
(`pytest --cov=codexloop --cov-fail-under=100`).

## Testing philosophy

- **Fakes over mocks.** Every port gets a real class implementing the same
  `Protocol`, checked by `mypy --strict`.
- **No real sleeping, ever, in a test.** `FakeClock` / `FakeSleeper` let a
  simulated weekly-window wait or a scripted top-up run in microseconds.
- **Hypothesis property tests for anything numeric or time-based** — in
  particular, no input whose `error.code` is in the non-waitable set may
  ever produce a waitable state.
- **`# pragma: no cover` must carry a reason.**

## The onion architecture import rule

`domain/` imports nothing but the standard library. `application/` imports
`domain/` and defines ports as `Protocol`. `infrastructure/` is the *only*
place `openai` may appear in an `import` statement or `codex` may be spawned.
`cli/` talks to `application/` via `bootstrap.py`, never to
`infrastructure/` directly. Nothing, anywhere, imports `anthropic` or
`claude_agent_sdk`.

Enforced by `import-linter` in CI and pre-commit — not by convention. See
[ADR 0001](docs/architecture/adr/0001-onion-import-linter.md).

## Non-negotiables (do not regress these)

- Never block on a human.
- Quota / billing ≠ rate-limit window (`CreditsExhausted` has no reset).
- A capacity rejection always outranks a completion claim.
- Body-first classification: `error.code` / `error.type` before HTTP status.
- Never bare `codex`. Never `--full-auto`.

## PR checklist

- [ ] Branch created from `develop`, named `feature/<short-description>`
- [ ] Commits (or the squash-merge title) follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] `pre-commit run --all-files` passes
- [ ] `pytest` and `pytest -m system` pass; the 100% coverage floor holds
- [ ] New numeric or time-based logic has a Hypothesis property test
- [ ] No new cross-layer imports that `lint-imports` would reject
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior changed
- [ ] Agent surfaces kept in sync (Claude / Cursor / Codex / Antigravity)
- [ ] A new ADR under `docs/architecture/adr/` if this PR makes a hard,
      non-obvious design call
- [ ] You agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and to license
      this contribution under the MIT License
