# codexloop

> **Now part of the vibey monorepo.** `codexloop` lives in [the-vibey-project/vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) at [`src/vibey_runners/codex`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex) (vibey ADR-0021). It is not published on its own any more: it ships inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution, so `pip install vibey` installs it (vibey ADR-0037).

**Onion-architected, autonomous OpenAI Codex / GPT session runner and
generated OpenAI SDK CLI** — never blocks on a human, never treats
`insufficient_quota` as a waitable `rate_limit_exceeded` window, and resumes
safely across usage windows.

## What problem this solves

Codex sessions hit usage limits. A `codex exec` process exiting doesn't
tell you whether the *task* finished or just that *turn* did. And an HTTP
429 from OpenAI is two different failures behind one status code:
`rate_limit_exceeded` / `usage_limit_reached` are windows that reset on
their own; `insufficient_quota` / `credit_balance_exhausted` are billing
walls that never will, no matter how long you wait. OpenAI's own guidance
is not to retry the second kind.

`codexloop` exists to get all three of those distinctions right,
automatically, so you can hand it a plan and walk away — including noticing
a top-up or a plan-window reset on the next probe rather than at some fixed
deadline.

It is a deliberate transplant of the [claudeloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude)
design — same state machine, same ports, same run-directory layout —
retargeted at the OpenAI stack. The primary transport is `codex exec --json`
as a subprocess, which is exactly what the official TypeScript Codex SDK does
under the hood ([ADR 0002](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex/docs/architecture/adr/0002-subprocess-codex-exec.md)).
There is **no Anthropic dependency**.

## Install

Requires **Python 3.12+**, **macOS or Linux**, and the
[Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`codex` ≥ 0.40 on `PATH`)
signed in via `codex login` **or** an `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Windows is not a
supported target.

```bash
pipx install vibey      # or: uv tool install vibey / pip install vibey
                        # the whole family; codexloop is one of its console scripts
codexloop doctor      # reports which auth mode is active; it never guesses
```

See the [getting-started guide](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex/docs/getting-started.md)
for a from-source setup.

## Quickstart

```bash
codexloop doctor                        # codex version, login status, probe strategies, MCP OAuth
codexloop capacity                      # ChatGPT plan windows when known; says so honestly when not
codexloop run plan.md --max-turns 20    # seed a run from a markdown plan and drive it to completion
codexloop run plan.md --network-access  # trusted task that needs PostgreSQL/HTTP access
codexloop resume --last                 # or: codexloop resume <thread-id>
codexloop threads                       # this product's run registry (not vendor Codex sessions)
codexloop api models list               # any OpenAI SDK endpoint (generated; see docs)

# Mid-run control (second terminal, same cwd):
codexloop status
codexloop logs
codexloop prompt --now "Also cover the error path"   # or --next-turn
codexloop model <model>                              # queued for the next control boundary
codexloop effort high                                # low | medium | high
codexloop approval never                             # approval policy
codexloop sandbox workspace-write                    # sandbox mode
codexloop watch --follow                             # or --replay for the Textual stream UI
codexloop stop                                       # graceful stop at the next control boundary
codexloop wind-down --reason "capacity exhausted"    # finish the turn, write a handoff, exit
codexloop savepoints
codexloop unwind 1                                   # git save-point restore (refuses while live)
```

`--transport app-server` opts into the experimental Codex app-server protocol
and falls back to `exec` when it is unavailable
([ADR 0009](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex/docs/architecture/adr/0009-optional-app-server.md)).

Network access remains off by default in the `workspace-write` sandbox. Enable
it per invocation with `--network-access`, per process with
`CODEXLOOP_NETWORK_ACCESS=true`, or in `codexloop.toml` with
`network_access = true`. This permits outbound command networking generally; it
is not a localhost- or PostgreSQL-only allowlist. Use it only for trusted tasks.
Runs record the effective `sandbox_mode` and `network_access` values in
`.codexloop/runs/<run_id>/meta.json`. Because the app-server transport cannot
currently express this setting, CodexLoop uses the exec transport whenever it
is enabled.

## Why it's different from just retrying on 429

| | Naive retry | `codexloop` |
|---|---|---|
| Sees an HTTP 429 | Sleeps a fixed duration, retries | Classifies **body-first** — `error.code` / `error.type` before the status: `rate_limit_exceeded` and `slow_down` are short throttles, `usage_limit_reached` is a plan window, `insufficient_quota` / `credit_balance_exhausted` / `usage_not_included` are billing walls |
| Credits exhausted | Sleeps forever, no reset time exists | `CreditsExhausted` structurally has no `resets_at` field. Probes on a bounded backoff and tells you it needs you |
| Plan window (5-hour / weekly) | Guesses a sleep | Reads `Retry-After` / plan-window resets when the vendor supplies them; degrades to a bounded probe under `--max-wait`, never a blind sleep |
| Turn ends vs. task ends | A marker string, easily confused with a truncated limit message | Structured verdict via `codex exec --output-schema`, done marker (`CODEXLOOP_TASK_FULLY_COMPLETE`) as fallback, and *no signal is never completion* |
| Approval prompts | Hangs, or you reach for `--full-auto` (deprecated, then removed) | `-c approval_policy=never` **plus** `-c sandbox_mode=workspace-write` — non-blocking *and* confined; `danger-full-access` only behind a loud opt-in |
| Bare `codex` TUI | Waits on a TTY | Never invoked; the argv builder forbids it and the child is spawned with stdin closed |

## Project status

Pre-1.0, but functional through milestone **M5**: onion core, `codex exec`
gateway, layered capacity probe (exec floor + optional app-server + rollout
tail), control plane, generated OpenAI REST CLI with a drift gate, and the
optional app-server transport with exec fallback. Later releases added the
`-v`/`-q` verbosity ladder, `--run-id`, wind-down, and capacity forecasting
(measurement only, off by default). Coverage floor is **100%** for the whole
package. `pytest -m system` runs a scripted agent with no OpenAI account;
`pytest -m live` is opt-in.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Env prefix | `CODEXLOOP_*` |
| State dir | `.codexloop/runs/<run_id>/` |
| Auth | `OPENAI_API_KEY` **or** `codex login` (`$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) — never mixed |
| Done marker | `CODEXLOOP_TASK_FULLY_COMPLETE` |
| Effort levels | `low` / `medium` / `high` (Codex `model_reasoning_effort`) |

## Security

This tool runs Codex with `approval_policy=never` by design (that's what
makes autonomous operation possible), confines it to `sandbox_mode=workspace-write`
by default, and handles OpenAI credentials. See
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/blob/develop/src/vibey_runners/codex/SECURITY.md)
for the threat model and how to report a vulnerability.

## Related projects

Same contract, different vendor. The four `*loop` runners share one domain
state machine, one set of application ports, and one `.<name>loop/runs/<id>/`
layout — pick the one that matches the agent you pay for:

| Runner | Drives | Command |
|---|---|---|
| [claudeloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/claude) | Claude Code (Anthropic) | `claudeloop` |
| **codexloop** (this package) | OpenAI Codex / GPT | `codexloop` |
| [cursorloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/cursor) | Cursor Agent (Composer-first; Grok as a model profile) | `cursorloop` |
| [agyloop](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/agy) | Google Antigravity / Gemini | `agyloop` |

All four ship inside the [`vibey`](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/) distribution: one
`pip install vibey` puts every command above on `PATH` (vibey ADR-0037).

Around them:

- [vibey](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey) — queue-based, six-phase conductor (spec interview → design → build → review → deploy) that drives these four runners as interchangeable engines, plus the local runner in [`src/vibey_runners/qwen`](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/tree/develop/src/vibey_runners/qwen) as a fifth: `gptossloop`, the sovereign default on GPT-OSS, and the opt-in `qwenloop` on Qwen (vibey ADR-0015, ADR-0060).
