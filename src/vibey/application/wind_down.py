"""Wind-down orchestration: what happens when a build engine exits with
EXIT_CODE_WIND_DOWN instead of finishing (handoff-protocol.md §3, §6).

The pipeline, in order, is the whole point of the no-loss design:

1. Load this cycle's BUILD ledger range and write it, complete and
   verbatim, to ``<worktree>/.vibey/handoff/ledger.jsonl`` -- the
   incoming engine always gets the full conversation being handed off,
   never just the brief.
2. Produce a brief with the deterministic floor producer (the outgoing
   engine is winding down; asking it for prose is optional quality, the
   floor is guaranteed correctness) and verify it through the gate
   escalation ladder (STRICT x3 -> FULL_TRANSCRIPT -> HUMAN).
3. A gate that ends in HUMAN parks the job -- a handoff that fails the
   no-loss gate is never a silent partial.
4. Bound the livelock (TooManyWindDowns -> park) and select the next
   engine via RotationHandoffService.
5. Persist the HandoffEnvelope, then enqueue the follow-up
   ``build.implement`` whose payload carries the rendered seed prompt and
   whose requirement excludes the engine that wound down.

The winding-down job itself settles Success: wind-down is a graceful
capacity event, not a failure, and must not burn the escalation ladder.
