"""Projection from vibey's own state onto Kubernetes status conditions.

Pure by design: no kopf, no Kubernetes client, no I/O. The operator is
thin glue around this module, so the decisions that actually matter --
when a project is Ready, when it is Parked, which answers may be applied
-- are testable without a cluster.

Condition vocabulary follows Kubernetes' own convention rather than
inventing one: `status` is "True"/"False"/"Unknown" for the condition's
*type*, `reason` is a CamelCase token a machine can branch on, and
`message` is the part a human reads. Anyone who can read a Deployment's
conditions can read these.
