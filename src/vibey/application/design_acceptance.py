"""Accepts a synthesized DESIGN spec using real ledger-derived guard evidence.

`vibey design accept` is also the explicit `DESIGN -> VISUAL_DESIGN` / `DESIGN
-> BUILD` choice gate from phase-protocols.md section 1.5: the caller states
`visual_choice` up front (there is no interactive park/answer round trip yet
-- see the CLI's `--visual/--no-visual` flag), the choice is ledgered as
`VisualDesignOptedIn`/`VisualDesignDeclined` before the phase transitions, and
silence is never treated as consent because the default is DECLINED, not
OPTED_IN.
