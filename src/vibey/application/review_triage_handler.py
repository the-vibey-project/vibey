"""Durable ``review.triage`` handler (M7 task 7.4 & 7.5).

Performs severity x ambiguity classification on open findings:
- Severity: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW.
- Ambiguity: CLEAR (all 4 conjunctive conditions met) vs NEEDS_CLARIFICATION.
- Evaluates next_phase_after_review from domain/phase.py:
  - If no findings: routes to DONE and enqueues ``review.deployment_choice``.
  - If CLEAR findings only: fast loop-back to BUILD (enqueues ``build.plan``).
  - If any NEEDS_CLARIFICATION or strict: routes to DESIGN (enqueues ``design.interview``).
- Increments the cycle and updates project state on loop-back.
- Critical findings unconditionally require Effort.MAX.
