"""Durable ``visual.inventory`` / ``visual.plan`` handlers.

Task 5.7/5.8 scaffolding: an inventory producer fills the screen/state matrix
from the accepted DESIGN spec, and the plan stage publishes it as a reviewable
artifact. Media generation, the design-system contract, and the review gate
(tasks 5.8's remaining artifacts, 5.9-5.13) are not built yet -- this only
covers the inventory itself, mirroring how design/spec.py started in M1
before anything consumed it.
