"""The production default BriefProducer: vibey's own deterministic
template (handoff-protocol.md §6.5, option 4 -- "the floor"), promoted
from the forced-rotation test's `_DeterministicFloorProducer`. Built
directly from the same projections the no-loss gate checks, so it passes
the gate by construction; a wind-down's StopSummary.remaining_work is
merged in on top because the outgoing engine's final snapshot may know
about remaining work no ledger verdict recorded yet (R1 only checks
ledger -> brief coverage, so extra brief items are always safe).
