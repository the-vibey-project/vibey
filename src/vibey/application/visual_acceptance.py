"""Accepts or waives the VISUAL_DESIGN interstitial (M5 task 5.13).

`vibey visual accept` / `vibey visual waive` are the `VISUAL_DESIGN -> BUILD`
guard from phase-protocols.md: build cannot consume an incomplete or
unreviewed visual plan. The decision is ledgered as VisualDesignAccepted or
VisualDesignWaived before the phase transitions, mirroring how
DesignAcceptanceService ledgers the DESIGN choice gate.
