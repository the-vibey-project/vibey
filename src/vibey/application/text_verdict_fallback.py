"""TRIVIAL-effort extraction fallback (handoff-protocol.md §3.3): for
engines that cannot produce structured output, a cheap extraction pass
parses the free-text turn into the same verdict schema structured engines
return natively, so extract_events() never needs to know which path a
turn came from.

No live model access was available while building this, so this is a
deterministic heuristic parser rather than the real TRIVIAL-effort model
call the design calls for -- it recognizes a small set of line-prefix
conventions (`Question:`, `Decision:`, `Assumption:`, `Remaining:`,
`Done.`) rather than genuinely understanding prose. It is the seam a real
cheap-model extraction call would replace without touching
extract_events() or anything downstream of it.
