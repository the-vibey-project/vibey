"""Starting a project's DESIGN interview, in one place.

This used to live as a private helper inside the CLI, which was fine while
the CLI was the only way in. It is not: the Kubernetes operator creates
projects from a custom resource, and runbook 05 names the failure that
follows -- a second entry point growing its own copy of the transition and
enqueue logic, which then drifts. Both callers use this function.

    Idempotent through the job's idempotency key: calling it twice for the
    same project and cycle yields the same job rather than a second
    interview. That matters more for the operator than the CLI, since a
    reconcile loop will call it again every time it is unsure.

    `origin` participates in the idempotency key, so a project started from
    a custom resource and one started from the CLI are distinguishable in
    the ledger without changing behaviour.

    `priority`, when given, enqueues the interview already bumped (ADR-0054): it runs
    next, after whatever is running, through the same grant every bump passes.
