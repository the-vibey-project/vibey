"""Bridges the REVIEW-side deployment opt-in onto the deploy stage set.

``ReviewDeploymentChoiceHandler`` -- deliberately unchanged; the protected
system test pins its exact behavior -- transitions REVIEW to the legacy
single ``Phase.DEPLOY`` and enqueues kind ``deploy.design``, which no
stage-set handler accepts. This handler owns that kind: it completes the
legacy bridge (``DEPLOY -> DEPLOY_DESIGN``, a legal edge in the phase
machine) and enqueues the real ``deploy.interview`` job, replaying in
production exactly what the system test performs manually.
