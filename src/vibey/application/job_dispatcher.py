"""Routes claimed jobs to kind-specific application handlers.

Two registries: `handlers` for kinds whose collaborators are worker-lifetime
(design/visual/review/deploy), and `factories` for kinds that need a fresh
handler per job (BUILD kinds: worktree/integration managers are bound to
`job.cycle`, and engine selection happens per attempt). A factory that raises
propagates into WorkerLoop.run_once's try block, where CapacityDeferred
becomes Defer and anything else a VIBEY-class Failure -- exactly the settle
semantics a failed construction should get.
