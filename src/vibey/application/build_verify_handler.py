# Made with ❤️ by [Vibey](https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey/), Developed by [Adam Matthew Steinberger](https://vibewithadam.matthewsteinberger.com/) ([@adammatthewsteinberger](https://github.com/adammatthewsteinberger/)).
"""Durable ``build.verify`` handler (M6 task 6.5): the project's own gates,
acceptance-criterion coverage, and a diff review by an engine that must
differ from the implementer -- deliberately a separate job from a different
engine than the one that wrote the code (phase-protocols.md section 2.3).

Verification is not "the model says it's fine." In order:

1. The work item's own gate commands (``ruff``, ``mypy``, ``pytest``, ...
   from ``vibey.toml``/the decomposer's ``VerificationSpec``). A non-zero
   exit is a ``WORK`` failure, full stop -- mechanical, no judgment involved.
2. Acceptance-criterion coverage: the item's verification must actually
   name which criteria it checks. An item with no criteria_checked never
   silently passes.
3. Only then, a diff review by a rotated engine at LOW effort, judged by
   the same VerdictRendered.complete convention build.implement uses.

The rotation in step 3 is the default, not an absolute: a configured pool
with nobody else to review lets the implementer review its own diff, and
the waiver is written to the ledger as a decision (see
``VerifyIndependencePolicy``). See ``selection_inputs_for_job`` for why the
rule lives there and is merely consulted here.

On success, enqueues build.integrate (task 6.8), keyed to this verify job's
own id so a repair verify job (a fresh row, not a retry of this one) always
gets its own integrate job rather than colliding with a prior attempt's
idempotency key.
