"""Durable ``build.integrate`` handler (M6 task 6.8): merges one verified
work item's branch into the shared integration branch, runs the full gate
suite against the merged result, and never rolls back the whole phase for
one bad item -- a merge conflict or a post-merge gate failure produces a
``FindingRaised`` event and a targeted repair ``build.implement`` job based
on the integration branch's current head, not a rollback of everything
(phase-protocols.md section 2.4).

Concurrency: concurrent ``build.integrate`` jobs for the same
(project, cycle) are serialized through the optional ``lock``
(IntegrationLock -- a Postgres advisory lock in production). Contention
defers the job for a short retry instead of blocking the worker; the lock
is released in a ``finally`` so a crashed merge can never wedge the
branch for every other worker.
