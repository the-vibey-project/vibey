"""Durable ``review.demo`` handler (M7 tasks 7.1 & 7.3).

Produces the review demo artifacts under ``.vibey/runs/<cycle>/review/``:
- ``DEMO.md``: what was built, per acceptance criterion, with evidence
- ``run-it.sh``: exact commands to see it working locally (executable)
- ``walkthrough.md``: narrated tour of significant diffs by intent
- ``evidence/test-report.xml`` & ``evidence/coverage.json``: gate evidence
- ``deltas.md``: what changed vs the spec, and why, generated directly from
  projections so assumptions and findings cannot be silently omitted.

Task 7.3: Runs automated reviews (code review, security review) and raises pre-triaged
findings on the ledger before the human developer sees them.

On success, records an ARTIFACT_PRODUCED ledger event and enqueues ``review.collect``.
