"""Durable ``build.implement`` handler (M6 task 6.4): engine selection
(single injected adapter for now -- full rotation wiring is a later task,
same position design.interview's "interviewer" was in after M5), worktree
creation, agent-surface provisioning, run, tail, and ledger persistence.

Effort escalates by attempt using the same pure ladder domain/effort.py
built in M1 -- an exhausted ladder parks for a human gate rather than
failing outright, since attempt 7 means autonomous escalation has nothing
left to try.

Forced rotation (task 6.6): when an attempt's effort crosses a tier
boundary (attempts 3 and 5 per BUILD_LADDER), ``forces_rotation`` returns
True and the handler enforces that the injected engine differs from the
previous attempt's engine.  The constraint is checked, not performed --
``BuildImplementHandler`` receives a single ``EngineAdapter``, so real
rotation (selecting from a pool) is a caller responsibility not yet built
in BUILD.  This is the same "documented, not faked" approach
``build.verify``'s must-differ-from-implementer constraint uses.

On success, enqueues build.verify (task 6.5) against the same worktree, so
implement never leaves a completed item with no next step queued -- the same
pattern design_handler.py's follow-up enqueue and visual_handler.py's
inventory->plan chaining use.
