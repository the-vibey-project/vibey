"""Turning exceptions into something an operator can act on.

Every CLI command runs inside ``asyncio.run(...)``, so an unhandled error
arrives as a traceback whose most prominent frames are asyncio's. That is the
worst possible presentation: the interesting line is buried, and a person who
is not a Python developer has no way to read it.

``guard`` renders known errors as one plain sentence plus, where we have one,
the next thing to try. Unknown errors keep their traceback -- suppressing a
stack trace we do not understand would trade a confusing message for a silent
one.
