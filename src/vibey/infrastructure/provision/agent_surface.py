"""Materializes the agent-guidance router files into a BUILD worktree
(M6 task 6.3, ADR-0011). Writes are content-addressed: a router file whose
merged content already matches what's on disk is left untouched, so
re-provisioning an already-correct worktree performs zero writes and, when
nothing changed at all, no git calls either.

Generated files are registered in the worktree's shared `.git/info/exclude`
(never the project's own `.gitignore`) so a project's own hand-written
CLAUDE.md etc. is never clobbered in its working tree and generated content
never lands in a commit -- exactly ADR-0011's "Bad, but" tradeoff.

The router files remain the stable cross-engine surface. When a project enables
`skills_context`, Vibey invokes the independently versioned `vibey-skills`
process/JSON contract and appends its bounded packet to the engine plan; the
generated index and packets live under `.vibey/` and are excluded below. The
full marketplace is deliberately not copied into every worktree.
