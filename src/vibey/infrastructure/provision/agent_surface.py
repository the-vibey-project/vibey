"""Materializes the four agent-guidance router files into a BUILD worktree
(M6 task 6.3, ADR-0011). Writes are content-addressed: a router file whose
merged content already matches what's on disk is left untouched, so
re-provisioning an already-correct worktree performs zero writes and, when
nothing changed at all, no git calls either.

Generated files are registered in the worktree's shared `.git/info/exclude`
(never the project's own `.gitignore`) so a project's own hand-written
CLAUDE.md etc. is never clobbered in its working tree and generated content
never lands in a commit -- exactly ADR-0011's "Bad, but" tradeoff.

The marketplace skill directories (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`,
`.cursor/rules/`, `.agent/`) from ADR-0011's table are not materialized here:
there is no `vibey-skills` (formerly `vibe-engineering-skills`) marketplace available in this build
environment to pull skill content from. Only the four router files -- the
part that's genuinely self-contained -- are provisioned. Replace this
docstring note, not the emitter's signature, once real marketplace access
exists.
