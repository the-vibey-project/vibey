"""kopf handlers for the VibeyProject custom resource.

Deliberately thin. Every decision worth testing lives in
`application/operator_projection.py`, which is pure, and every write goes
through the same application services the CLI uses -- runbook 05 names the
alternative as a real risk: a custom resource growing its own copy of the
transition, enqueue, and answer logic, which then drifts from `vibey new`
and `vibey answer` without anyone noticing.

The CR is declarative and level-triggered, so every handler here must be
safe to run again on unchanged input. Creating a project is guarded by the
id recorded in `status`; enqueueing the interview is guarded by the job's
idempotency key; answering is guarded by the gate no longer being open.
