"""Real git-worktree lifecycle for BUILD work items (M6 task 6.2).

Every mutating call is preceded by a self-healing step (`git worktree
prune` plus removing any leftover directory at the target path) rather than
trusting prior state, because the property that matters is: a `create()`
call always succeeds in leaving a clean, usable worktree, even if the
previous attempt for the same item was killed mid-operation. That is what
makes "SIGKILL mid-create leaves no orphan worktree" true -- not a
best-effort cleanup step someone has to remember to call, but every create
healing whatever it finds first.
