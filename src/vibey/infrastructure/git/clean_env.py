"""A git-invoking subprocess executor that strips GIT_* environment
variables, shared by every module in infrastructure/git/ and infrastructure/
provision/ that shells out to `git`.

A caller running inside a git hook (pre-commit, itself invoked from `git
commit`) has GIT_DIR/GIT_INDEX_FILE/GIT_WORK_TREE etc. set in its own
environment, pointing at *that* repository's plumbing. Subprocesses inherit
the parent environment by default, so an unfiltered `git -C <other repo>
...` call silently operates against the wrong repository instead of the one
`-C` names -- GIT_DIR overrides discovery outright. This bit
GitWorktreeManager during development (caught by running its tests through
the actual pre-commit hook); every other git-shelling module uses this same
executor from the start rather than rediscovering the bug.
