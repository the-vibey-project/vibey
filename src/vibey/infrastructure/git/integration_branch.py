"""The integration branch/worktree that build.integrate merges verified work
items into, one at a time (M6 task 6.8). Reuses GitWorktreeManager's scheme
with a reserved item_id, "integration", rather than inventing a second
worktree mechanism -- it accumulates state across many merges the same way
create()/ensure() already distinguish "wipe and recreate" from "return what's
already there"."""
