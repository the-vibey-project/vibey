"""Postgres advisory lock scoped to (project_id, cycle) -- the
IntegrationLock implementation that lets multiple workers safely share one
integration branch.

Session-level advisory locks live on the connection that took them, so a
held lock pins its pooled connection out of the pool until release. That
is deliberate: releasing the connection back would silently drop the lock
the moment another query reused the session. try_acquire never blocks
(``pg_try_advisory_lock``) -- contention is the caller's cue to defer the
job, not to wait.
