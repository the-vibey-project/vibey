"""Run-directory tailer: events.jsonl -> vibey LedgerEvents.

The runner's own event vocabulary (EngineEvent.kind) is deliberately the
same string vocabulary as domain.ledger.EventKind's values -- every adapter
is expected to normalize into it before vibey ever sees a line, the same
way domain/capacity.py's ADT is "inherited from the *loop family, unchanged
in spirit." Translation is therefore a validated identity mapping, not a
lookup table that could silently drop an unrecognized kind.

What this module does *not* do: mint event_id/seq/digest. Those are
assigned by vibey at ledger-append time (handoff-protocol.md §2 design
principle 4 -- ids are minted by vibey, never the agent), which happens in
the application layer once a project_id/cycle/phase/job_id context is
available. This module produces the fully-formed draft up to that point.
