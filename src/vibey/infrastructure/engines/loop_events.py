"""Event type translation: loop event_type vocabulary → vibey EventKind.

Real loop events.jsonl files use dotted event_type strings ("chatter.assistant",
"sdk.message", "RateLimitEvent") rather than vibey's EventKind vocabulary.
This module maps the observed real event types to EventKind, engine by engine.

CLAUDELOOP and AGYLOOP's mappings are built from real events.jsonl captured
by real, authenticated, live runs (see docs/plans/fleet/
e1-loop-event-map-vibey.md and the conformance investigation it closed
out) -- an earlier version of this file claimed the same for every engine
while actually containing fabricated event_type strings for all four
(session.user_turn, function.call, thread.message.user, agent.savepoint,
...: none of these are real).

CODEXLOOP and CURSORLOOP previously carried that same unverified guesswork.
It was replaced (2026-08-18) with vocabulary read directly from each
engine's own source -- real string literals their own code already
recognizes or emits, not fabrications. At the time, neither engine wrote
anything into events.jsonl in this environment at all (both sinks were
fully implemented but not wired into the real run path -- see
docs/plans/fleet/c4-wire-events-sink-{codexloop,cursorloop}.md); both gaps
were fixed and landed the same day (codexloop#30, cursorloop#27). Current
verification status per engine:

- CODEXLOOP: `infrastructure/events.py::JsonlRunEventSink` is now
  constructed in `bootstrap.py` and wired into `CodexExecGateway`, which
  emits the vocabulary below (sourced from
  `infrastructure/agent/events.py::JsonlParser`, the exact type strings it
  parses from the wrapped `codex exec --json` subprocess's own stdout) to
  the sink after every turn. Verified end to end with a real subprocess
  smoke test -- a fake `codex` binary on PATH (codexloop's own
  `tests/shim/fake_codex.py` harness) driving the real, unmodified
  `CodexExecGateway.send_turn` code path -- confirming events.jsonl is
  genuinely populated with this vocabulary. Not yet observed against a
  live, authenticated `codex` CLI session, since `codex` isn't installed
  in this environment.
- CURSORLOOP: the sink is now wired into the scripted/test-agent path too
  (previously live-SDK-only), confirmed by a real scripted `cursorloop
  run` populating events.jsonl. That confirms the forwarding mechanism,
  not the vocabulary itself: the actual event types
  (`tool_call`/`status`/`usage`) still come only from
  `infrastructure/agent/translate.py::TeeStream`'s
  `_on_tool_call`/`_on_status`/`_on_usage`, which only executes in the
  live Cursor Agent SDK path -- those three string literals are hardcoded
  verbatim in that source (reading them is equivalent to observing them),
  but still unconfirmed against a real live SDK session, since no
  CURSOR_API_KEY is available here. Cursorloop also has no wrapper-level
  session/turn/verdict boundary event in events.jsonl at all, unlike the
  other three engines -- only in-turn SDK message types.

One turn, one TURN_COMPLETED. The budget brake (LedgerBudgetSource) counts
every TURN_COMPLETED in a cycle as a turn against ``max_cycle_turns``, so
each engine maps only the runner's own turn boundary to it -- one event per
real turn -- and nothing else. Text that rides alongside a turn
(claudeloop/agyloop ``chatter.*`` echoes, qwenloop's streamed
``text_delta`` fragments) maps to TRANSCRIPT_RECORDED: kept in the ledger
for replay, never counted. Before #266 ``chatter.assistant`` also mapped to
TURN_COMPLETED, so under claudeloop's default ``log_chatter=summary`` a
cycle hit its turn cap after half the configured turns, and every qwenloop
token delta counted as a turn. TURN_REQUESTED follows the same rule
(``turn.starting`` only, not ``chatter.prompt``).
