"""The sovereign DESIGN provider: phase one without paid credentials (8.a).

Doctrine 8.a makes the 100% sovereign path the preferred way to run. Until now it could
not run at all: `EngineId.QWENLOOP` was wired as a BUILD executor, but DESIGN is phase
one and its only live provider was ClaudeLoop. A project could not be started without
paid credit, which makes the "preferred" path the one that cannot go first.

This talks to the local model directly over Ollama's chat API rather than shelling out
to the `qwenloop` binary. That is deliberate: `qwenloop run` takes a plan file and
`qwenloop prompt` needs an existing run id, so neither offers the one-shot
prompt-to-JSON this needs — and going direct buys the property that matters here.

**Constrained decoding.** Ollama compiles the schema to a grammar and zeroes the
probability of any token that would break it, so malformed JSON is not reachable. The
paid provider has to hunt for ```json fences and cope with prose wrapped around the
answer; this cannot receive either. The weaker model is, on shape alone, the more
reliable of the two.

What it cannot do is research, and that is stated rather than worked around — see
`research()`.
