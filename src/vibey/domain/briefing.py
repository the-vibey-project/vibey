"""The deterministic template brief: vibey's own floor producer
(handoff-protocol.md §6.5, option 4). Built directly from the same
projections domain/noloss.py's gate checks, so it always passes the gate
by construction -- no model call, less fluent than an LLM-written brief,
but never lossy. This is what makes "all engines are down" a
degraded-quality scenario rather than a data-loss one."""
