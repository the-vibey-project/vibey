"""The visual-design interstitial's inventory (M5 task 5.7).

A ``VisualInventory`` is the screen/state matrix a ``visual.inventory`` job
produces: every surface the spec implies, each with the responsive states,
accessibility requirements, and media manifest entries the visual-plan and
generation stages (tasks 5.8-5.11, not yet built) will consume. This module
only carries the shape and its completeness check -- generation, providers,
and review are separate, not-yet-implemented milestones.
