    `infrastructure/db/design_ledger.py` and `review_ledger.py` both write
    `causation_id=None` unconditionally -- so every one of them is invisible
    here. Only BUILD verdicts, which carry the run that produced them, appear.

    That is a real narrowing and it is accepted deliberately, on a condition
    that can be checked rather than assumed: nothing in production reads this
    projection. `build_work_ledger` and `WorkLedgerEntry` are referenced by
    tests/domain/test_projections.py and by nothing else under src/vibey --
    no handler, no CLI command, no TUI view. So the events it omits are not
    omitted from anything a user or a worker sees.

    The condition is the thing to re-check, not the behaviour. The moment a
    caller appears, decide first whether it wants BUILD threads only. If it
    wants DESIGN and REVIEW too, the fix belongs in those two ledgers -- give
    their verdicts a real causing id -- and not here, because bucketing them
