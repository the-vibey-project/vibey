    one holding a candidate with a positive effective weight -- a local engine is
    chosen whenever one can be, and a paid engine only when none can. Weight is
    the test, not mere presence, so a tier whose every member has decayed to
    zero cannot strand a job that a healthy paid engine could take.

    When no tier qualifies, every candidate is returned unchanged and `select`
    raises its own NoEligibleEngine, which is the truthful answer.

    Module-level, like `eligible` and `select` beside it: a pure function of its
    argument, with no collaborators and no state. Converging this module onto
