"""The latch that catches SIGTERM before anything can act on it.

Linux discards a signal sent to PID 1 while its disposition is still ``SIG_DFL`` -- it is
not queued for later. A container therefore loses any termination signal that arrives
before its process installs a handler, and the pod runs on until its grace period expires.
For a vibey worker that is two hours, and it was observed on minikube: a pod deleted 0.2s
after its container started sat through the whole window claiming jobs nobody wanted.
