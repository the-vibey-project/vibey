"""Faked full-worker E2E (worker-orchestration plan, milestone test A).

A real project travels INTAKE -> DESIGN -> BUILD -> REVIEW -> DONE(local)
through `bootstrap.build_full_worker`'s dispatcher against real Postgres and
a real temp git repository -- ScriptedEngine adapters and scripted providers
stand in for models, but every queue transition, gate park/answer/resume,
worktree, merge, subprocess gate, and ledger write is the production code
path `vibey worker` runs.
