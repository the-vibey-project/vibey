"""Faked-mode conformance against REAL installed binaries, not ScriptedEngine.

test_faked_conformance.py only ever exercises the in-memory ScriptedEngine
double -- it never spawns a real subprocess, so it can't catch a bug in
argv construction, real events.jsonl production, or LOOP_EVENT_MAP
translation the way a real (even if scripted-mode) engine run can. This
file closes that gap for the three engines that ship their own
env-gated scripted/offline agent (claudeloop, codexloop, cursorloop):
`LoopProcessAdapter` drives the real installed binary, which runs its own
scripted agent instead of calling a real model -- no network, no API key,
no cost, but a genuine subprocess spawn through the real production code
path `vibey doctor --conformance` and `vibey worker` both use.

agyloop has no scripted/offline agent of its own (confirmed: no
ALLOW_TEST_AGENT env gate anywhere in its source) -- there is currently no
way to exercise it here without a real, paid Gemini call, so it stays on
the ScriptedEngine-only test in test_faked_conformance.py. That's a real,
documented gap, not an oversight; see
docs/plans/fleet-program-runbook.md's scripted/offline agent table.

cursorloop is xfail (strict) here, not skipped or passing -- this real
subprocess-level test found genuine, previously-unknown bugs in those
repos themselves, distinct from anything vibey's own code was doing
wrong:

- cursorloop: `infrastructure/agent/scripted.py`'s ScriptedAgentGateway
  raises IndexError on an unexpected second `send_turn` call --
  AutonomousRunner sends a "Continue exactly where you left off" follow-up
  prompt after a scripted "done" turn instead of recognizing the verdict
  as complete, crashing the run.

Queued as a real fleet plan file, not fixed inline here, since it
requires understanding that engine's own control-flow in enough depth to
place the fix correctly. `strict=True` means the xfail turns into a real
failure the moment its underlying repo is out of sync with this comment
(e.g. someone "fixes" it without updating this file) -- that's
intentional, not a bug in this test.

codexloop was xfail here too, and is expected to PASS as of PR #72. The
upstream gap it named is still real -- `infrastructure/rundir.py` writes
meta.json exactly once, at run-directory creation, and never a terminal
status, so `process_exited_without_terminal_status` still appears in this
test's own logs and docs/plans/fleet/d0-meta-status-codexloop.md is still
queued. What changed is that vibey stopped depending on it: codexloop#35
added a `run.verdict` event and #72 maps it, so completion is detected
through the verdict path instead of meta.json. The strict xfail is what
surfaced the drift, turning into a failure the moment its premise stopped
holding -- exactly as the paragraph above intends.

Every test here skips (not fails) when its binary or fixture script isn't
present on this machine -- mirroring test_paid_preflight.py's pattern --
since these tests depend on sibling repo checkouts at ~/git/<engine> that
won't exist in every environment (e.g. a clean CI runner that only checks
out vibey).
