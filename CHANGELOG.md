# Changelog

Every release of `vibey` on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vibey/), newest first. From 0.2.0 on there
are no `vibey-v*` tags, so headings carry the release commit's date instead of a compare link, and
0.2.0 through 0.6.0 were reconstructed from the release commits on 2026-09-15 (ADR-0028).

The design behind these releases is written up as a research paper —
[PDF](https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey/main/paper.pdf) ·
[HTML](https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey/main/paper/) — and the complete documentation is
published as a book — [PDF](https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey/main/book.pdf) ·
[EPUB](https://the-vibey-project.github.io/vibey/main/book.epub).

## [Unreleased]

### Features

* **ci:** `develop` admits changes through a declared merge queue, and CI answers `merge_group` events so the queue can see its own checks. A pull request whose checks passed against an older base proves only that combination was green; nothing between that base and `develop`'s tip was ever built with it, and `strict_required_status_checks_policy` buys that proof by hand, one rebase at a time, with the base moving underneath. The queue is declared in `.vibey-gh.toml` rather than clicked, so it can be reviewed and restored like any other branch rule, and it is off by default for everyone else ([ADR-0036](docs/architecture/decisions/0036-the-merge-queue-is-declared-not-clicked.md))

### Bug Fixes

* **worker:** a deferring worker says why -- one `job.deferred` log line per deferral naming the job kind, the work item, the reason and the retry time, so a job that can never make progress no longer looks like an idle worker. The line is written after the queue transition, never before: a worker whose lease expired mid-handler has deferred nothing, and it says `job.defer_rejected` at warning instead of claiming a `retry_at` the job never took
* **build:** a one-engine pool (`vibey work --engines qwenloop`) can verify its own work instead of stalling BUILD forever. The `build.verify` independence rule excluded the implementer unconditionally, so a single-engine pool had nothing eligible left, `NoEligibleEngine` became a capacity defer, and the job retried with no park and nothing in the ledger. The exclusion is now waived only when honoring it would leave the configured pool with no reviewer at all, and the waiver is written to the ledger as a decision and to the job result as `independent_review: false` — a non-independent diff review is allowed there, never hidden. With two or more usable engines the rule is unchanged. The waiver decision is written only once the item really passed verification — the ledger is append-only, so a failing gate must not leave behind an entry saying the item was verified — and `verify.require_independent_review = true` in the project config restores the strict rule for projects that would rather stall than accept a self-review ([ADR-0035](docs/architecture/decisions/0034-independence-is-the-default-not-an-absolute.md)).

* **design:** the ledger names the engine that actually did the DESIGN work. `design.interview` and
  `design.research` events were attributed to claudeloop whatever `--provider` was in force, so a
  sovereign run on qwenloop -- and a scripted run with no engine at all -- wrote a false actor into
  an append-only record. Each `DesignProvider` now declares its own `engine_id` (`None` for the
  scripted one) and the composition root reads it; the `design.synthesize` exclusion follows the
  same derived value ([#115](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/issues/115))
* **ledger:** every phase move now writes the `PhaseTransitioned` event the ledger always declared,
  in the same transaction as the compare-and-set that moves the phase — so a project's path through
  the six phases is reconstructable from its own history, and no move can commit without its event

* **review:** REVIEW no longer runs a hard-coded security scan. `bandit -q -r src` walked the
  absorbed workspace members and failed every cycle, looping REVIEW back into BUILD forever; no
  narrower path is right for anyone else either, because `bandit` exits 0 on a path that does not
  exist, so a baked-in default would report a passing security check that examined zero files.
  Both the security and code-review command lists are now project configuration
  (`review.security_commands`, `review.code_review_commands`), and `security_commands` defaults to
  empty — a project that wants the check configures it
### Documentation
* stop tracking the two built documentation sites (`site/` and `src/vibey_tools/gh/site/`): 5.8 MB of stale rendered HTML — a second, drifting copy of the docs, the ADRs and the runbooks — that `properdocs build` regenerates and that CI never reads ([#155](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/issues/155))

## [0.7.0] (2026-09-15)

### Features

* **gh:** the book and the research paper linked from every page's navigation and footer, the channel chooser and `llms.txt`, and attached to each GitHub Release; this repository adopts `github-release.yml` ([#147](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/issues/147)) ([c696374a](https://github.com/the-vibey-project/vibey/commit/c696374a51a2c08f82d7c53f1f1fe1ecda55b22b))
