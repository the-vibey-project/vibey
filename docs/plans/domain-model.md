# Domain Model

> **Status as of 2026-09-15 (v0.6.0):** checked against `src/vibey/domain/`
> and current. Corrections in this revision: the import rule now follows
> [ADR-0017](../architecture/decisions/0017-dogfood-the-family-first.md); the security
> primitives are plain classes; `check_clear_conditions` implements three of its
> four conditions; rotation's smoothness property, the probe backoff floors, the
> retry-ladder bound, the command deny-list, and gate rule R7 are stated as the
> code behaves. Every layer, not only this one, now carries a 100% branch
> coverage gate ([ADR-0023](../architecture/decisions/0023-four-layers-four-floors.md)).

> Everything in `src/vibey/domain/`. **Stdlib, itself, and any family package
> that is itself dependency-free** (`vibey-gh`, `vibey-skills` and
> `vibey-runners-common` all declare `dependencies = []`); `vibey_bootstrap` is
> forbidden by name because it carries the Azure SDK and OpenTelemetry
> ([ADR-0017](../architecture/decisions/0017-dogfood-the-family-first.md)). No I/O, no async,
> no clock, no network — the import rule is enforced by `import-linter`, the rest
> by `tests/domain/test_domain_purity.py`, which walks the AST. Every value type
> here is a frozen, slotted dataclass and every function is pure, with one
> carve-out: the three security primitives in §19 are plain classes, and
> `PromptShield.frame_untrusted_input` mints a random nonce with
> `secrets.token_hex` unless the caller passes `nonce=`. This layer carries a 100%
> branch coverage floor because it is the layer where being wrong is silent.

## 1. Why the domain is this large

A thin domain would push the six-phase machine, the rotation algorithm, and the
no-loss gate into `application/`, where they would be tested against fakes rather
than against their own properties. The three things vibey must get right —
*which engine next*, *did the handoff lose anything*, *is this transition legal* —
are all pure functions of state. They belong here, where Hypothesis can attack
them without a database.

## 2. `phase.py`

```python
class Phase(StrEnum):
    INTAKE = "intake"; DESIGN = "design"; VISUAL_DESIGN = "visual_design"
    BUILD = "build"; REVIEW = "review"
    DEPLOY_DESIGN = "deploy_design"      # Phase ④
    DEPLOY_EXECUTE = "deploy_execute"    # Phase ⑤
    DEPLOY_REVIEW = "deploy_review"      # Phase ⑥
    DEPLOY = "deploy"                    # legacy single-phase bridge
    DONE = "done"; ABANDONED = "abandoned"


TERMINAL: frozenset[Phase] = frozenset({Phase.DONE, Phase.ABANDONED})
INTERACTIVE: frozenset[Phase] = frozenset({
    Phase.DESIGN, Phase.VISUAL_DESIGN, Phase.REVIEW,
    Phase.DEPLOY_DESIGN, Phase.DEPLOY_REVIEW,
})


class CompletionMode(StrEnum):
    LOCAL = "local"; DEPLOYED = "deployed"


class VisualDecision(StrEnum):
    OPTED_IN = "opted_in"; DECLINED = "declined"; ACCEPTED = "accepted"
    WAIVED = "waived"


class DeploymentDecision(StrEnum):
    OPTED_IN = "opted_in"; DECLINED = "declined"
```

`Phase.DEPLOY` is a legacy single-phase bridge kept alongside the ④–⑥
deployment stage set (`DEPLOY_DESIGN` / `DEPLOY_EXECUTE` / `DEPLOY_REVIEW`);
both `DONE` and `REVIEW` still have edges into it. The legal edges of the
machine live in a private `_EDGES: dict[Phase, frozenset[Phase]]` table,
checked independently of guard evaluation.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class PhaseState:
    phase: Phase
    cycle: int
    max_cycles: int
    entered_at: datetime

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        if self.cycle < 1:
            raise InvalidPhaseError("cycle must be >= 1")
        if self.max_cycles < 1:
            raise InvalidPhaseError("max_cycles must be >= 1")


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class TransitionEvidence:
    """Everything a guard needs. Assembled by application/, evaluated here."""

    reason: str
    evidence: TransitionEvidence


Allowed = Literal["allowed"]
ALLOWED: Allowed = "allowed"

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Denied:
    violations: tuple[str, ...]

TransitionOutcome = Allowed | Denied


def evaluate_transition(state: PhaseState, request: TransitionRequest) -> TransitionOutcome:
    """Checked in order: (1) the edge must exist in `_EDGES`, (2) `cycle` must
    not exceed `max_cycles` unless routing to `ABANDONED`, (3) any per-edge
    guard registered in `_GUARDS` must report no violations."""


def next_phase_after_design(*, visual_decision: VisualDecision, spec_is_buildable: bool) -> Phase:
    """Raises InvalidPhaseError on a non-buildable spec; otherwise VISUAL_DESIGN
    on opt-in, else BUILD directly."""


def next_phase_after_review(findings: Sequence[FindingRef], *, strict_loopback: bool) -> Phase:
    """The routing decision from ADR-0010. No findings -> DONE. strict_loopback
    or any NEEDS_CLARIFICATION finding -> DESIGN. Otherwise -> BUILD."""


def next_phase_after_deploy_review(
    findings: Sequence[FindingRef] = (),
    *,
    demo_accepted: bool = False,
    target_changed: bool = False,
    retry_unambiguous: bool = False,
    code_defect: bool = False,
) -> Phase:
    """The routing decision from ADR-0013 for Phase ⑥. Priority order:
    demo accepted (or nothing outstanding) -> DONE; a code defect -> DESIGN;
    a changed deployment target -> DEPLOY_DESIGN; an unambiguous retry ->

```

Every guard function (`_guard_design_to_build`, `_guard_build_to_review`, …) is
registered in a private `_GUARDS: dict[tuple[Phase, Phase], Callable]` table
keyed by the edge it guards, so `evaluate_transition` never has to know which
guard applies — it just looks the edge up.

### Invariants

- `DONE` and `ABANDONED` have no outgoing edges except `DONE`'s bridge into
  `DEPLOY` / `DEPLOY_DESIGN`.
- No transition is legal when `cycle > max_cycles` except `→ ABANDONED`.
- `DESIGN → BUILD` and `DESIGN → VISUAL_DESIGN` share a common guard: at least
  one acceptance criterion, no open blocking question, no unmapped criterion, and
  a user verdict of `ACCEPT`.
- `DESIGN → BUILD` additionally requires an explicit visual-design **decline**;
  opting in must route through `VISUAL_DESIGN` first. `DESIGN → VISUAL_DESIGN`
  additionally requires an explicit opt-in.
- `VISUAL_DESIGN → BUILD` requires the visual plan accepted-or-waived *and* a
  complete screen/state inventory.
- `BUILD → REVIEW` requires every work item settled, the integration branch
  green, every acceptance criterion covered by a passing test, and a build
  savepoint at the integration head.
- `BUILD → DESIGN` requires at least one work item blocked on ambiguity.
- `REVIEW → DONE` requires no open findings and a user verdict of `ACCEPT`.
- `REVIEW → DEPLOY_DESIGN`, `DONE → DEPLOY` and `DONE → DEPLOY_DESIGN` require
  an explicit deployment opt-in.
- `DEPLOY_DESIGN → DEPLOY_EXECUTE` requires both an accepted deployment spec
  and recorded consent.
- `DEPLOY_EXECUTE → DEPLOY_REVIEW` requires the deployment to be verified or
  classified as needing user input.
- `DEPLOY_REVIEW → DONE` requires the deployment demo to be accepted.
- `DEPLOY_DESIGN` and `DEPLOY_EXECUTE` each have an unguarded self-edge
  (revise or retry within the phase); every other unlisted edge is unguarded
  and decided by the handler that requests it.
- `evaluate_transition` is total: every `(state, request)` pair returns
  without raising.

`supports_cwd_flag` and `plan_flag` exist because each engine's CLI was
verified against its actual `--help` output, not assumed: passing a flag a
binary doesn't have, or a positional path to a binary that wants a flag,
fails at argument parsing before the session ever starts.

## 5. `capacity.py`

Inherited from the `*loop` family, unchanged in spirit and in the one rule that
matters.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)

    # There is deliberately NO resets_at field here, and there never will be.
    # A credits balance has no clock. Only a human top-up changes it.

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class AuthenticationFailed:
    detail: str = ""

CapacityState = Available | WindowExhausted | CreditsExhausted | AuthenticationFailed
```

---

## 6. `circuit.py`

```python
class CircuitState(StrEnum):

@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class DeadlineProbe:
    at: datetime

    Available -> None (no probe needed). WindowExhausted with a known

    seeded from the reset time and attempt so retries stay reproducible).
    WindowExhausted with no reset time -> a backoff schedule (base 2s,
    doubling, capped at 5 minutes). CreditsExhausted -> a backoff schedule

- `health_factor`: `1.0` closed (decaying with `ewma_failure`), `0.25`
  half-open, `0.0` open. Half-open is a *quarter*, not a half (ADR-0005): a
  circuit under test should win a round only when the alternatives are
  genuinely worse, not on even footing with a healthy engine.
- `fidelity_factor`: `1.0` at the requested tier, `0.7` one tier short,
  `0.5` two-or-more tiers short — an engine that saturates far below what was
  asked for is worse than one that just misses.
- `affinity_factor`: `2.0` for a warm session unless rotation is forced
  (then `1.0`) — this is what keeps an ordinary retry from becoming a
  handoff on every retry.

### Properties

| Property | Statement |
|---|---|
| **No starvation** | Over `sum(effective_weight)` consecutive selections, every candidate with `effective_weight > 0` is selected at least once |
| **Weight fidelity** | Selection counts converge to weight ratios within ±1 over any full period |
| **Smoothness** | Selections are spread across the period rather than bunched: a candidate never monopolizes every slot while another with `effective_weight > 0` waits. SWRR interleaves proportionally but does not forbid repeats — with weights 5:1 the heavy candidate wins three rounds in a row before the light one is chosen |
| **Determinism** | Identical candidate state produces an identical selection |
| **Totality** | `select` raises `NoEligibleEngine` iff every `effective_weight` is 0, or if the input is empty |
| **Unique identity** | `select` raises `ValueError` if two candidates share an `engine_id` |
| **Exclusion honored** | An engine in `requirement.excluded` is never returned |

## 9. `handoff.py` and `noloss.py`

```

`verify` runs ten independent checks, each producing zero or more
`Violation`s, keyed by the `GateRule` it enforces:

| Rule | Checks |
|---|---|
| R1 | Every item in the latest `VerdictRendered` event's `remaining_work` appears in `brief.remaining` |
| R2 | Every open `QuestionAsked` id (per `open_items`) appears in `brief.open_questions` |
| R3 | Every open `DecisionRecorded` id appears in `brief.decisions` |
| R4 | Every open `AssumptionStated` id appears in `brief.assumptions` |
| R5 | Every open `FindingRaised` id appears in `brief.open_findings` |
| R6 | `ref.digest`, `ref.event_count`, and `ref.to_seq` all match the ledger range actually supplied |
| R7 | Every `ArtifactProduced` event whose payload sets `referenced_by_open_item` appears (by `artifact_id`) in `brief.artifacts` — the event's writer, not the gate, decides what counts as referenced |
| R8 | The ledger's summed `BudgetSpent` dollars/turns match `budget.dollars_spent` / `budget.turns_spent` |
| R9 | Every hard `spec_constraints` string appears in `brief.constraints` |
| R10 | No brief text field contains a phrase from the containment denylist (tool grants, permission changes, acceptance-criteria mutation, prompt-injection phrases like "ignore previous instructions", `sudo`) |

Under `GateMode.FULL_TRANSCRIPT`, R1–R5, R7, and R9 are auto-satisfied
(closure over the brief no longer means anything once the whole ledger range
is inlined into the prompt) — but R6, R8, and R10 still run, because they
check facts about the range and the brief's containment, not brief
completeness. R10 is the security control from the architecture threat model:
an untrusted brief field is data the *next* engine reads, so it is scanned
for injection before that handoff completes.

## 11. `visual.py` and `media.py`

The visual-design interstitial's inventory, and the media-provider selection
that will eventually fill it in. Both are shape-only: generation, providers,
and moderation are separate, not-yet-implemented milestones (tasks 5.9–5.11,
plus the remaining design-system artifacts of 5.8); these modules only cover
*what a complete inventory looks like* and *which provider, if any, is
eligible*. The `visual.inventory` / `visual.plan` handlers consume `visual.py` through
`application/visual_spec.py` and `application/interfaces/visual.py`, and the
task-5.13 accept/waive gate (`application/visual_acceptance.py`) reads the
inventory they publish;
`media.py` has no consumer outside `domain/` yet.

```python
# visual.py
class MediaModality(StrEnum):
    IMAGE = "image"; AUDIO = "audio"; VIDEO = "video"

    NoEligibleEngine on an empty candidate list or an all-zero-weight set;

```

The domain never imports an SDK or knows a provider/model name. It evaluates
capability, policy, region, health, and budget facts supplied by `application/`;
the infrastructure adapter performs the actual generation.

    gate checks against, so it always passes the gate by construction — no
    model call, less fluent than an LLM-written brief, but never lossy. This
    is what makes "all engines are down" a degraded-quality scenario rather
    than a data-loss one."""
```

`next_action` is taken from the first item in the latest `VerdictRendered`
event's `remaining_work`, or `"Review and accept."` if there is none;
`decisions` includes only decision refs that are not yet superseded.

## 13. `plan.py`

BUILD decomposition: the work-item graph and its two structural rules

## 14. `projections.py`

Pure projections over a replayed event range (architecture-and-roadmap.md

## 15. `config.py`

Parsing and validation of the `vibey.toml` schema — see
[configuration reference](../reference/configuration.md) for the full field
list with defaults. Pure: this module accepts already-loaded TOML text or a
dict and returns either a validated `VibeyConfig` or raises `ConfigError`; it
never touches the filesystem — reading the file is an infrastructure concern.

applies the `VIBEY_FEATURE_QWENLOOP` override; as of 2026-09-15 it has no
runtime caller (see `docs/reference/configuration.md`).

## 16. `provision.py`

Agent-surface provisioning content rules (task 6.3, ADR-0011): one source of
truth for the non-negotiables/plugins/context block, materialized
idempotently into every engine's router file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
`CURSOR.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `QWEN.md`). Pure content generation and the
marker-delimited merge that preserves hand-written guidance outside vibey's
block; the actual filesystem/git I/O lives in `infrastructure/provision/`.

## 17. `worktree.py`

Pure naming rules for BUILD work-item worktrees (task 6.2): no I/O, just the
deterministic path/branch scheme the infrastructure worktree manager uses,
kept pure so the manager and any future caller (e.g. a status report) never
disagree about where a work item's worktree lives.

```python
def validate_item_id(item_id: str) -> None:
    """Raises ValueError unless item_id is 1-64 chars, lowercase
    alphanumeric and hyphens, starting with alphanumeric."""

def worktree_subpath(cycle: int, item_id: str) -> str:
    validate_item_id(item_id)
    return f".vibey/worktrees/{cycle}/{item_id}"

def branch_name(cycle: int, item_id: str) -> str:
    validate_item_id(item_id)
    return f"vibey/{cycle}/{item_id}"
```

Both raise `ValueError` (via `validate_item_id`) before producing a name, so no
path or branch is ever built from an unvalidated id. The integration branch
uses the reserved item id `integration` (`vibey/<cycle>/integration`).

Returns a relative path string rather than a `pathlib.Path`: `domain/`
forbids `pathlib` (checked by `test_domain_purity.py`), so joining this onto
a repo root is the infrastructure layer's job.

## 18. `verbosity.py`

Resolving how loud the process should be, from CLI flags. Pure: no logging
library, no I/O — the ladder is a domain decision because it has to mean the
same thing everywhere; an operator who learns `-vv` on one runner should not
get something different from the next one.

```python
VALID_LEVELS = ("DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")

class Verbosity(IntEnum):
    """QUIET and NORMAL differ only in level. The three DEBUG tiers differ in
    *scope*: our own logs, then third-party libraries, then full payloads —
    because "more detail" past DEBUG is not a level, it is a wider net."""
    QUIET = -1; NORMAL = 0; VERBOSE = 1; TRACE = 2; FIREHOSE = 3


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class LogPlan:
    """The resolved logging intent a composition root acts on."""
    level: str
    include_third_party: bool
    include_payloads: bool


def parse_verbosity(*, verbose: int = 0, quiet: bool = False) -> Verbosity:
    """Raises ValueError if --quiet and --verbose are both set."""

def resolve_log_plan(*, verbose: int = 0, quiet: bool = False, log_level: str | None = None) -> LogPlan:
    """An explicit --log-level always wins over the -v count — naming a
    level and having it silently overridden by a count (possibly set in an

    widens scope independently, so `--log-level WARNING -vvv` is a
    legitimate way to ask for warnings from everything: include_third_party
    from TRACE and up, include_payloads from FIREHOSE."""
```

## 19. Security primitives: `command_guard.py`, `scope_guard.py`, `prompt_shield.py`

Three self-contained defensive modules with full unit coverage. They are
plain classes rather than frozen dataclasses, and `frame_untrusted_input` is
deterministic only when a `nonce` is passed. **None of them are constructed
anywhere in `bootstrap.py`**, and nothing in `application/` or
`infrastructure/` calls them — see
[SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) for the current disclosure of what this
means for the guarantees vibey actually provides today; do not rely on any
of them being enforced until that changes.

## 22. What must never appear in `domain/`

Checked by `import-linter` (`.importlinter`, contract `domain-independence`)
and by `tests/domain/test_domain_purity.py`, which walks the AST:

- `import asyncio`, `async def`, `await`, `async with`, `async for`
- `open()`, `pathlib`, `subprocess`, `socket`, `os.getenv()`
- `asyncpg`, `psycopg`, `httpx`, `requests`, `typer`, `structlog`,
  `pydantic`, `textual`
- `vibey_bootstrap` — forbidden by name (ADR-0017); dependency-free family
  packages (`vibey_gh`, `vibey_skills`, `vibey_runners.common`) are allowed
- `vibey.application`, `vibey.infrastructure`, `vibey.cli`, `vibey.tui`
- `datetime.now()`, `datetime.today()`, `time.time()` — time is always a
  parameter, never ambient

`os.environ` access is **not** caught today: the AST walker checks only calls
of the form `module.attr()`, and although the test module defines an
`("os", "environ")` pair in `FORBIDDEN_CALLS`, that set is never consulted.
No domain module reads the environment; the rule is held by review, not by the
test.

That last one is why every function here takes `now: datetime`. It is what makes
the wait-policy and circuit-breaker tests deterministic instead of flaky.
