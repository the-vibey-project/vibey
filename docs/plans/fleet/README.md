# Fleet program — dogfooding mechanics

> **Status as of 2026-09-15: dormant.** These scripts drove the August 2026

This directory holds the per-run plan files that drive the fleet program
(`docs/plans/fleet-program-runbook.md`) autonomously, one *loop runner at a
time, in disposable worktrees. The overall program plan (sequencing, verified
state, phase breakdown) is [`docs/plans/fleet-program-runbook.md`](../fleet-program-runbook.md).

## Launching a run

```bash
scripts/fleet/run.sh REPO PHASE [DRIVER]
# e.g.
scripts/fleet/run.sh agyloop b-soft-stop agyloop
scripts/fleet/run.sh vibey e1-live-engines claudeloop
```

This creates (or reuses) `~/.cache/fleet-worktrees/<repo>-<phase>` on branch
`chore/<phase>` off `origin/develop`, and hands the plan file
`docs/plans/fleet/<phase>-<repo>.md` to the chosen driver with the agreed
caps (`--max-turns 800 --max-dollars 80 --max-wait 21600`), `--cwd` pinned to
the worktree on every subcommand that supports it. `run.sh` injects no
system-prompt note: protected paths are named in each plan file and enforced by
`land.sh`. (claudeloop has since gained `--append-system-prompt`, from
`c2-append-system-prompt-claudeloop.md`, but `run.sh` does not use it.)

## Landing a run

```bash
scripts/fleet/land.sh REPO PHASE
```

Pushes the branch, opens (or reuses) a PR against `develop`, watches checks,
and squash-merges **only if every check is green and the diff does not touch
a protected path**. A protected-path diff or a red PR is left open with an
explanation — never silently merged.

## Smoke-testing the fleet

```bash
scripts/fleet/smoke.sh [--repo NAME]... [--live] [--skip-conformance]
```

The fleet-wide gate: the same 7-gate sweep every PR is judged on (4x
100%-branch coverage layers, ruff check/format, mypy --strict, lint-imports,
bandit, pip-audit), run against each repo's actual primary checkout on its
current branch — plus, for vibey, the two-mode `tests/live/` harness
(ADR-0030) and `vibey doctor --conformance` across every installed engine
binary. Defaults to all 5 repos; pass `--repo NAME` (repeatable) to scope it.
Meant to be green before any TestPyPI/PyPI publish (Phase F's `harness` gate).

The harness has two markers in `pyproject.toml`: `live` (faked mode — real
loop binaries driven by scripted agents) and `paid` (real models; needs API
keys and costs money). The default `addopts` exclude only `paid`. Real-model
tests are selected with `pytest -m paid`. `smoke.sh --live` still runs
`pytest -m live --max-dollars 5` with `VIBEY_LIVE_ENGINES` set; pytest defines
no `--max-dollars` option, so that invocation aborts with an
unrecognized-argument error.

## Protected paths

A run must not modify these without explicit human review:

- `tests/infrastructure/db/test_chaos.py` — the chaos test
- `tests/domain/test_noloss*.py`, `tests/domain/test_briefing.py` — the
  no-loss property suite
- `tests/system/test_delivery_stage_set.py` — the full-cycle system test
- `tests/live/**` — the two-mode harness (`-m live` faked, `-m paid` real),
  landed with vibey PR #17

**`land.sh`'s refusal is superseded** (#213). It was the only guard, it was dormant,
and it targeted repositories that no longer exist. The rule is now enforced from
configuration, in the repository itself:

- `.github/CODEOWNERS` owns these paths (and itself), and `require_code_owner_review =
  true` on both rulesets in `.vibey-gh.toml` makes GitHub demand the owner's approval;
- `[merge_train] protected_paths` in `.vibey-gh.toml` makes the merge train refuse such
  a pull request outright ("needs a human merge"), because the train's `--admin`
  fallback would bypass the code-owner review;
- `tests/meta/test_protected_paths_agree.py` fails when those two lists drift apart or
  a pattern stops matching any tracked file.

The no-loss suite is also no longer only protected but measured: CI's required
`No-loss property suite (10,000 examples)` job runs it at the definition of done's
10,000 examples per property. `land.sh` keeps its old `PROTECTED_PATTERN` only because
this page and `run.sh` still describe the dormant fleet flow; it is not the source of
truth, and the list above is.

## Known gaps that shape the launcher today

- **codexloop's `run` has no `--cwd`** — still true at codexloop 0.4.0. The
  c-guardrails phase added `--cwd` across claudeloop only, not to `codexloop run`.
  `run.sh` works around it by `cd`-ing into the worktree before invoking
  codexloop — this is exactly the class of incident `--cwd` normally
  prevents, so codexloop runs need extra care.
- **`cursor-agent` is not installed** on the development machine (checked
  2026-09-15; `codex` now is). cursorloop plan files therefore assume a driver
  of `claudeloop` (cross-repo dogfooding: claudeloop's own agent does the work
  on the cursorloop code) until `cursor-agent` is installed. When this was
  written (2026-08-17) `codex` was missing too.
- `scripts/fleet/status.sh` tabulates every worktree under
  `~/.cache/fleet-worktrees/` with its PR and check state — run it any time
  to see what's in flight.

## Plan-file status

| Status | Plan files | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Landed | `agent-docs-{agyloop,claudeloop,codexloop,cursorloop,vibey}` | each runner directory carries `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`GEMINI.md` and the agent-surface trees |

`patches/cursorloop-wind-down-draft.patch` is superseded by the landed
cursorloop wind-down.

## Concurrency

At most 5 runs in flight at once (agreed budget). Each run gets its own
worktree and PR; they don't interact except by landing onto the same
`develop` branch, so land in whatever order goes green first.
