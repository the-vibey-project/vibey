# Data Model

> **Status as of 2026-09-15:** DDL in §3 is quoted from `migrations/0001`–`0011`
> (the full set on `develop`). Sections that described tables with no migration
> (visual revisions, deployment contracts), a `vibey migrate` command, a
> transition advisory lock, and pruning/partitioning have been corrected to what
> the code does; the original designs are kept and marked **proposed** or
> **planned**. Several provisioned tables (`work_item`, `open_item`, `artifact`,
> `budget_ledger`) exist in the schema but no repository reads or writes them yet
> (see §3).

> PostgreSQL 17. All timestamps `timestamptz`. All ids `uuid` except `event.seq`
> (gapless bigint per project) and human-facing item ids (short prefixed strings).
> Migrations are forward-only and applied automatically by `build_app()`
> (`src/vibey/bootstrap.py`) every time a CLI command or worker opens the
> database through it; there is no `vibey migrate` command (§7).

## 1. Why PostgreSQL

Recorded fully in [ADR-0002](../architecture/decisions/0002-postgres-not-sqlite.md).
The short version:

| Requirement | SQLite | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|---|
| N workers claiming jobs concurrently | no row locks, **no `SKIP LOCKED`** | `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` |
| Crash-safe leases | mark-then-return leaks locked rows forever | lease + expiry + reaper |
| Worker wakeup without polling | poll only | `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY` |
| Ledger payload queries | `json1`, no real index | `jsonb` + GIN |
| Phase-transition mutual exclusion | file lock | row-level compare-and-set (`UPDATE … WHERE phase = $expected`) |
| Shared integration branch | file lock | session advisory lock (`pg_try_advisory_lock`, ADR-0029) |

WAL mode fixes reader/writer blocking; vibey's contention is writer/writer.

## 2. Entity relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    project ||--o{ cycle_record : has
    project ||--o{ job : has
    project ||--o{ event : has
    project ||--|| event_seq : sequences
    project ||--o{ engine_health : tracks
    project ||--o{ rotation_cursor : rotates

    job ||--o{ human_gate : raises

    project ||--o{ artifact : produces

    handoff }o--|| engine_health : from
    handoff }o--|| engine_health : to
```

Every table except `project` and `job_dependency` carries a declared foreign key to
`project`; `job_dependency` references `job` twice, `handoff.job_id` and
`human_gate.job_id` reference `job`, and
`open_item.superseded_by` references `open_item`. The `work_item → job`, `event → open_item` and
`handoff → engine_health` edges are logical (text ids), not constraints.
`cycle_record` is a conceptual grouping by `(project_id, cycle)`; there is no
such table. `handoff.job_id` is always written as `NULL` today
(`PostgresHandoffRepository.record`).

---

## 3. Core tables

Every `CREATE` below is from a file in `migrations/`. Tables `work_item` (0004),
`open_item` (0005), `artifact` and `budget_ledger` (0008) are created and asserted
present by `tests/infrastructure/db/test_migrator.py`, but no repository in
`src/vibey` reads or writes them yet: their state currently lives in the ledger
(`event`), in in-memory projections (`domain/projections.py`), and in `.vibey/`
files.

### 3.1 `project`

```sql
-- 0001_project.sql
CREATE TYPE phase AS ENUM (
    'intake','design','build','review','deploy','done','abandoned'
);

CREATE TABLE project (
    id              uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name            text NOT NULL,
    repo_path       text NOT NULL,
    phase           phase NOT NULL DEFAULT 'intake',
    cycle           integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    max_cycles      integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 10,
    config          jsonb NOT NULL,           -- the resolved vibey.toml
    created_at      timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at      timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT project_cycle_bounded CHECK (cycle >= 1 AND cycle <= max_cycles + 1)
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX project_repo_uniq ON project (repo_path);

-- 0010_visual_design_phase.sql
ALTER TYPE phase ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'visual_design' AFTER 'design';

-- 0011_deployment_stage_set_phases.sql
ALTER TYPE phase ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'deploy_design' BEFORE 'deploy';
ALTER TYPE phase ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'deploy_execute' BEFORE 'deploy';
ALTER TYPE phase ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'deploy_review' BEFORE 'deploy';

-- resulting enum order: intake, design, visual_design, build, review,
--   deploy_design, deploy_execute, deploy_review, deploy, done, abandoned
```

Migrations 0010 (M5) and 0011 (M10) only widen the enum. The legacy `deploy` value
is never removed (PostgreSQL cannot drop an enum value) and no project rows are
rewritten. `Phase.DEPLOY` survives in `domain/phase.py` as a runtime bridge:
`ReviewDeploymentChoiceHandler` moves an opted-in project `review → deploy` and
enqueues `deploy.design`; `DeployDesignBridgeHandler` then moves it
`deploy → deploy_design` and enqueues `deploy.interview`, so target scope and
consent are re-established in phase ④ (ADR-0013, ADR-0014).

There is no persisted `completion_mode` column. The local-versus-deployed outcome
is carried in `TransitionEvidence.completion_mode` (`domain/phase.py`) and in the
handler's result payload; the durable record is the `DeploymentOptedIn` or
`DeploymentDeclined` ledger event, not a column on `project`.

### 3.1.1 Visual design state (file-backed; tables proposed)

The VISUAL_DESIGN interstitial persists no rows today. `FileVisualInventoryRepository`
(`src/vibey/infrastructure/db/visual_inventory_repository.py`) writes the screen
inventory, including each surface's media manifest (`asset_key`, `modality`,
`prompt`), to `<repo>/.vibey/runs/<cycle>/visual/inventory.json`, and `publish`
renders the context artifacts into `<repo>/.vibey/context/visual/`. Acceptance and
waiver are appended to the ledger as `VisualDesignAccepted` / `VisualDesignWaived`
(`application/visual_acceptance.py`). The DESIGN-side choice is appended as
`VisualDesignOptedIn` / `VisualDesignDeclined` by `DesignAcceptanceService`
(`application/design_acceptance.py`, from `vibey design accept --visual/--no-visual`)
before the phase transitions.

**Proposed, no migration.** The design calls for Postgres tables so generated
assets are immutable revisions with provenance and cost:

```sql
-- PROPOSED -- not in migrations/
CREATE TYPE media_modality AS ENUM ('image','audio','video');
CREATE TYPE visual_asset_decision AS ENUM ('pending','accepted','rejected','supplied','waived');

CREATE TABLE visual_revision (
    id                  uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id          uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle               integer NOT NULL,
    revision            integer NOT NULL,
    opt_in_event_id     uuid NOT NULL,
    inventory           jsonb NOT NULL,
    design_system       jsonb NOT NULL,
    accepted_at         timestamptz,
    UNIQUE (project_id, cycle, revision)
);

CREATE TABLE visual_asset (
    id                  uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    visual_revision_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES visual_revision(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    asset_key           text NOT NULL,
    screen_id           text NOT NULL,
    state               text NOT NULL,
    modality            media_modality NOT NULL,
    prompt              text NOT NULL,
    prompt_digest       text NOT NULL,
    provider_id         text,
    model_version       text,
    request_id          text,
    artifact_digest     text,
    artifact_uri        text,
    moderation          jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    rights_metadata     jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    retention_policy    text,
    cost_usd            numeric(12,6) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (cost_usd >= 0),
    decision            visual_asset_decision NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at          timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    UNIQUE (visual_revision_id, asset_key, prompt_digest)
);

CREATE TABLE media_provider_cursor (
    project_id          uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    modality            media_modality NOT NULL,
    cursor              bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (cursor >= 0),
    updated_at          timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY (project_id, modality)
);
```

Under that proposal the prompt is retained for reproducibility, secrets and
sensitive source content are redacted before persistence, and regeneration
creates a new `visual_asset` row rather than mutating accepted evidence.

### 3.1.2 Deployment state (file-backed; tables proposed)

Phases ④–⑥ persist no rows today. `FileDeploymentStateRepository`
(`src/vibey/infrastructure/deploy/state_repository.py`) writes the accepted
`DeploymentSpec` to `<repo>/.vibey/deploy/spec.json` and the `DeploymentConsent`
to `<repo>/.vibey/deploy/consent.json`. The REVIEW opt-in and decline are appended
as `DeploymentOptedIn` / `DeploymentDeclined`
(`application/review_deployment_choice_handler.py`), the accepted deployment spec as
a `DecisionRecorded`, and execution evidence as `ArtifactProduced` (success) or
`FindingRaised` (failure) events (`application/deploy_execute_handler.py`).

**Proposed, no migration.** The design calls for contract and attempt tables that
bind each attempt to the accepting and consenting ledger events:

```sql
-- PROPOSED -- not in migrations/
CREATE TYPE deployment_outcome AS ENUM (
    'running','verified_success','input_required','cancelled'
);

CREATE TABLE deployment_contract (
    id                  uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id          uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle               integer NOT NULL,
    revision            integer NOT NULL,
    target_scope_digest text NOT NULL,
    spec                jsonb NOT NULL, -- no secret values; references only
    accepted_event_id   uuid NOT NULL,
    consent_event_id    uuid NOT NULL,
    accepted_at         timestamptz NOT NULL,
    superseded_at       timestamptz,
    UNIQUE (project_id, cycle, revision)
);

CREATE TABLE deployment_attempt (
    id                    uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    contract_id           uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES deployment_contract(id),
    attempt               integer NOT NULL CHECK (attempt >= 1),
    outcome               deployment_outcome NOT NULL DEFAULT 'running',
    azure_operation_ids   text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    resource_ids          text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    artifact_digest       text NOT NULL,
    cost_usd              numeric(12,6) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK (cost_usd >= 0),
    started_at            timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    completed_at          timestamptz,
    evidence              jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    UNIQUE (contract_id, attempt)
);
```

Under that proposal, retrying an unchanged contract creates another attempt, and
changing scope creates a new contract revision that invalidates the previous
consent.

### 3.2 `event` — the ledger

```sql
-- 0002_event.sql
CREATE TYPE provenance AS ENUM ('trusted','agent','untrusted');

CREATE TABLE event (
    event_id        uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id      uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    seq             bigint NOT NULL,
    cycle           integer NOT NULL,
    phase           phase NOT NULL,
    kind            text NOT NULL,
    engine_id       text,                     -- NULL for vibey-authored events
    job_id          uuid,
    causation_id    uuid,
    correlation_id  uuid NOT NULL,
    provenance      provenance NOT NULL DEFAULT 'agent',
    produced_at     timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    payload         jsonb NOT NULL,
    digest          text NOT NULL,            -- sha256 of canonical payload
    CONSTRAINT event_seq_uniq UNIQUE (project_id, seq)
);

CREATE INDEX event_project_seq   ON event (project_id, seq);
CREATE INDEX event_kind          ON event (project_id, kind, seq);
CREATE INDEX event_correlation   ON event (correlation_id, seq);
CREATE INDEX event_payload_gin   ON event USING gin (payload jsonb_path_ops);

-- Append-only: no UPDATE, no DELETE. Enforced, not merely intended.
CREATE RULE event_no_update AS ON UPDATE TO event DO INSTEAD NOTHING;
CREATE RULE event_no_delete AS ON DELETE TO event DO INSTEAD NOTHING;
```

The `RULE`s make `UPDATE` and `DELETE` silent no-ops rather than errors: a stray
write affects zero rows.

**Search indexes.** `vibey ledger search` (sub-doctrine 7.a, #137) adds three
indexes for the dimensions 0002's could not serve:

```sql
-- 0012_event_search_indexes.sql
CREATE INDEX event_digest              ON event (digest);
CREATE INDEX event_project_produced_at ON event (project_id, produced_at);
CREATE INDEX event_project_engine      ON event (project_id, engine_id, seq);
```

`event_digest` is not unique and must not become so: `digest` is the SHA-256 of
the canonical payload alone, so every event with the same payload (`{}` is common)
shares one. A digest search returns a set; a record is named by `event_id`. The
free-text criterion (`payload::text ILIKE`) has no index — `event_payload_gin` is
`jsonb_path_ops`, which answers containment, not substrings — so it scans one
project's rows.

**The hash chain is derived, not stored.** There is no `prev_hash` column. The
`RULE`s above would silently discard a migration's backfill `UPDATE`, and a column
filled only by new appends would leave all existing history outside the chain.
Instead `domain/ledger_chain.py` recomputes it from the rows: each event's link is
the SHA-256 of the previous link and every column of the event (the payload through
its digest), starting from a per-project genesis. A window of events verifies alone
from the link before it, which is the hook the storage tiers' chunk hashes fold over
(#114).

**`correlation_id` is the delivery's; `causation_id` is the run's.** Every event
of one delivery — DESIGN, BUILD, REVIEW and the deploy stage set, in every cycle
— carries the same `correlation_id`, so `event_correlation` answers "show me
this whole delivery" in one index scan. The id is *derived* at each write site,
not separately allocated or handed across a process boundary:
`domain/correlation.py` folds the project id into a fixed namespace with `uuid5`,
so every worker computes the same value for the same project. The derived value is
still written on each event -- `event.correlation_id` is `NOT NULL` and
`event_correlation` indexes it -- which is what makes the one-scan query above
possible; what does not exist is an allocator to ask or an id to carry. It is
deliberately not keyed on `cycle` — a
REVIEW loop-back increments the cycle, and one delivery would otherwise acquire
a fresh id each time it went round.

`causation_id` carries what `correlation_id` used to: which engine run produced
this event. `run_and_record` writes the `RunSpec`'s `run_id`, so a row joins to
the run directory on disk, and `build_work_ledger` keys its per-work-thread
projection on it. Events vibey writes on its own account — a finding it raised,
a context packet it compiled — have no causing run and leave it `NULL`.

Both columns already existed. Before this, `correlation_id` was minted with
`uuid4()` at roughly ten separate write sites and `causation_id` was always
`NULL`, so one delivery left behind ten unrelated ids and could be reassembled
only by hand (issue #89).

**Gapless `seq`.** One counter row per project, claimed by an upsert inside the
insert transaction. `PostgresLedgerRepository.append` calls `append_event` inside
`conn.transaction()`:

```sql
-- 0002_event.sql
CREATE TABLE event_seq (
    project_id  uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    next_seq    bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 1
);

-- 0009_event_produced_at.sql (the 12-argument overload the repository calls)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION append_event(
    p_project_id     uuid,
    p_cycle          integer,
    p_phase          phase,
    p_kind           text,
    p_engine_id      text,
    p_job_id         uuid,
    p_causation_id   uuid,
    p_correlation_id uuid,
    p_provenance     provenance,
    p_produced_at    timestamptz,
    p_payload        jsonb,
    p_digest         text
) RETURNS bigint
LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE s bigint;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO event_seq (project_id, next_seq)
    VALUES (p_project_id, 2)
    ON CONFLICT (project_id) DO UPDATE SET next_seq = event_seq.next_seq + 1
    RETURNING next_seq - 1 INTO s;

    INSERT INTO event (
        project_id, seq, cycle, phase, kind, engine_id, job_id,
        causation_id, correlation_id, provenance, produced_at, payload, digest
    ) VALUES (
        p_project_id, s, p_cycle, p_phase, p_kind, p_engine_id, p_job_id,
        p_causation_id, p_correlation_id, p_provenance, p_produced_at, p_payload, p_digest
    );

    RETURN s;
END $$;
```

Migration 0002 created the original 11-argument `append_event` (no
`p_produced_at`), which fell back to the column default and silently replaced the
caller's timestamp with insertion time. Migration 0009 adds the overload above and
keeps the 11-argument function for compatibility. Before the call, the repository
redacts the payload (`infrastructure/ledger/redact.py`) and recomputes `digest`
over the redacted payload, so R6 range digests match what is stored.

Serializing appends per project is intentional. The ledger is the one place where
ordering is the whole point, and a project produces at most a few events per
second — the contention is negligible and the guarantee is absolute. Rule R6 of
the [no-loss gate](handoff-protocol.md#62-the-rules) depends on it.

### 3.3 `job` — the queue

```sql
-- 0003_job.sql
CREATE TYPE job_state AS ENUM (
    'ready','leased','succeeded','failed','awaiting_human','awaiting_capacity','cancelled'
);

CREATE TABLE job (
    id                uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id        uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle             integer NOT NULL,
    phase             phase NOT NULL,
    kind              text NOT NULL,          -- 'build.implement', …
    state             job_state NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ready',
    priority          integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    work_item_id      text,
    payload           jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    requirement       jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,  -- effort + capabilities + excluded
    idempotency_key   text NOT NULL,
    attempts          integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    max_attempts      integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 7,
    run_after         timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    lease_owner       text,
    lease_expires_at  timestamptz,
    assigned_engine   text,
    last_error        jsonb,
    created_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at        timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT job_idem_uniq UNIQUE (project_id, idempotency_key),
    CONSTRAINT job_lease_consistent CHECK (
        (state = 'leased') = (lease_owner IS NOT NULL AND lease_expires_at IS NOT NULL)
    )
);

-- The claim index. Partial: only 'ready' rows are ever scanned.
CREATE INDEX job_claim ON job (project_id, priority DESC, run_after ASC, id ASC)
    WHERE state = 'ready';

-- The reaper index.
CREATE INDEX job_expiring ON job (lease_expires_at) WHERE state = 'leased';

CREATE TABLE job_dependency (
    job_id            uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES job(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    depends_on_job_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES job(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (job_id, depends_on_job_id),
    CONSTRAINT no_self_dep CHECK (job_id <> depends_on_job_id)
);

CREATE INDEX job_dep_reverse ON job_dependency (depends_on_job_id);
```

**`idempotency_key`** is `sha256(f"{project_id}:{cycle}:{kind}:{subject}").hexdigest()`
(`domain/job.py::idempotency_key`). Enqueue uses
`ON CONFLICT (project_id, idempotency_key) DO NOTHING` and, on conflict, returns the
existing row, so a handler that crashes after enqueueing but before settling its own
job cannot create duplicate work when the job is replayed.

`awaiting_capacity` and `cancelled` are defined in the enum, but no repository
query sets them today: a capacity rejection is a `defer` back to `ready` with an
explicit `run_after` (§3.4).

### 3.4 Claim, heartbeat, ack, reap

```sql

UPDATE job SET state = 'ready', updated_at = now()
WHERE id = $1 AND state = 'awaiting_human';

-- REAP (each idle worker-loop iteration, before the 5 s LISTEN wait; no separate supervisor)
UPDATE job SET
    state='ready', lease_owner=NULL, lease_expires_at=NULL, updated_at=now()
WHERE state='leased' AND lease_expires_at < now();
```

All of these live in `PostgresJobRepository`
(`src/vibey/infrastructure/db/job_repository.py`), except the gate-answer
re-ready. PARK and DEFER refund the attempt so that waiting on a human or on
capacity never consumes `max_attempts`; this is how non-negotiable #1 (never
block a worker on a human) and the capacity-rejection rule reach the queue.

NACK's `'failed'` branch is a safety net, not the ordinary end of a job:
`WorkerLoop` checks the bound before it nacks and parks an `attempts_exhausted`
gate instead, GRANTing a wider bound first when the human already answered one
(ADR-0024). A `failed` row therefore means nobody was asked, which is a bug.

The reaper is what makes worker death safe, and is why every handler must be
idempotent (non-negotiable #6): a reaped job *will* be executed again. `vibey
worker`'s drive loop (`cli/main.py`) calls `reap()` only after a `run_once` that
found no claimable job, so a worker busy on long jobs does not reap; another idle
worker, or the next idle iteration, does.

### 3.5 `work_item`

Provisioned by 0004; not yet read or written by any repository. Work items are
currently carried as `job.work_item_id` and in job payloads.

```sql
-- 0004_work_item.sql
CREATE TYPE work_item_state AS ENUM (
    'pending','implementing','verifying','ready','integrated','blocked','waived'
);

CREATE TABLE work_item (
    item_id         text NOT NULL,            -- 'item-014', stable across cycles
    project_id      uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle           integer NOT NULL,
    title           text NOT NULL,
    state           work_item_state NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    acceptance_ids  text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    depends_on      text[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
    branch          text,
    worktree_path   text,
    attempt         integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    current_effort  smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,   -- Effort IntEnum
    last_engine     text,
    verification    jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
    blocked_reason  text,
    PRIMARY KEY (project_id, cycle, item_id)
);
```

### 3.6 `open_item` — the gate's working set

A projection, rebuildable from `event`. The table exists (0005) but is not yet
populated or read: the [no-loss gate](handoff-protocol.md) rebuilds the open set
in memory from the ledger range on every handoff (`domain/ledger.py::open_items`,
`domain/projections.py`, `domain/noloss.py`). Materializing it is a planned
optimization.

```sql
-- 0005_open_item.sql
CREATE TYPE open_kind AS ENUM ('question','decision','assumption','finding');

CREATE TABLE open_item (
    item_id       text PRIMARY KEY,           -- 'q_7f3a', 'd_44a1', 'a_0c2f', 'f_21c9'
    project_id    uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    kind          open_kind NOT NULL,
    opened_seq    bigint NOT NULL,
    closed_seq    bigint,                     -- NULL = still open
    superseded_by text REFERENCES open_item(item_id),
    blocking      boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    severity      text,
    ambiguity     text,                       -- 'clear' | 'needs_clarification'
    body          jsonb NOT NULL,
    normalized    text NOT NULL               -- for dedup on restatement
);

CREATE INDEX open_item_open ON open_item (project_id, kind)
    WHERE closed_seq IS NULL AND superseded_by IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX open_item_norm ON open_item (project_id, kind, normalized);
```

`normalized` is meant to hold a lowercased, punctuation-stripped form used to
recognize when an agent restates an existing open question in different words —
which would otherwise create a second id and make the gate demand both. The
normalizer exists (`application/verdict_extraction.py::normalize_text`) but is not
yet wired to this table or to the dispatch path.

### 3.7 `handoff`

```sql
-- 0006_handoff.sql
CREATE TABLE handoff (
    handoff_id      uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id      uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle           integer NOT NULL,
    phase           phase NOT NULL,
    job_id          uuid REFERENCES job(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    from_engine     text,                     -- NULL when synthesized
    to_engine       text NOT NULL,
    reason          text NOT NULL,
    from_seq        bigint NOT NULL,
    to_seq          bigint NOT NULL,
    range_digest    text NOT NULL,
    envelope        jsonb NOT NULL,
    gate_mode       text NOT NULL,            -- strict | full_transcript | human | forced
    gate_attempts   integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    gate_violations jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    accepted        boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    created_at      timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT handoff_range_sane CHECK (to_seq >= from_seq)
);

CREATE INDEX handoff_pair ON handoff (project_id, from_engine, to_engine, created_at DESC);
```

`PostgresHandoffRepository.record` writes one row per **accepted** handoff:
`gate_mode` and `gate_attempts` come from the final `GateResult`, and
`gate_violations` holds that result's violations (so `[]` for an accepted gate).
A gate that ends in `HUMAN` parks the job without writing a row, and the
violations of intermediate STRICT attempts are not stored. `job_id` is written as
`NULL`. The only production writer is the wind-down path
(`application/wind_down.py`), so `phase` is always `build` and `reason` is always
`rotation` today. Recording every attempt's violations — so it is measurable which
rules fire most, for which engine pairs, at which phases — is planned.

### 3.8 `engine_health` and `rotation_cursor`

```sql
-- 0007_engine_health_rotation.sql
CREATE TYPE circuit_state AS ENUM ('closed','half_open','open');

CREATE TABLE engine_health (
    project_id       uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    engine_id        text NOT NULL,
    installed        boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    version          text,
    conformance_ok   boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    conformance_at   timestamptz,
    auth_ok_at       timestamptz,
    circuit          circuit_state NOT NULL DEFAULT 'closed',
    capacity_state   text,                    -- last classified CapacityState
    resets_at        timestamptz,             -- ONLY ever set for WindowExhausted
    probe_next_at    timestamptz,
    probe_attempt    integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    consecutive_fail integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    ewma_failure     double precision NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.0,
    cost_usd_cycle   numeric(12,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    selected_count   bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (project_id, engine_id),
    CONSTRAINT credits_never_have_a_deadline CHECK (
        capacity_state IS DISTINCT FROM 'CreditsExhausted' OR resets_at IS NULL
    )
);
```

That last `CHECK` is the schema-level expression of the family's hardest-won rule:
**exhausted credits can never carry a reset time.** Conflating it with a rate-limit
window is the exact bug the `*loop` projects exist to avoid, so vibey makes it
impossible to represent, not merely discouraged.

```sql
-- 0007_engine_health_rotation.sql
CREATE TABLE rotation_cursor (
    project_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    engine_id   text NOT NULL,
    current     integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- SWRR running value
    "order"     integer NOT NULL,             -- deterministic tie-break
    PRIMARY KEY (project_id, engine_id)
);
```

One row per engine per project. `EngineSelector` (`application/engine_selector.py`)
advances the cursors through `PostgresRotationCursorRepository.update_many`, which
upserts every candidate's row in its own transaction. That happens inside the
handler, after `claim` has already leased the job on a separate connection — the two
writes are **not** in one transaction, despite what the repository docstring says. A
crash between selection and the engine run can therefore advance the cursor without
doing the work; the reaper re-runs the job and the next selection continues from the
advanced cursor. Rotation fairness can skew by one step per crash; no work is lost.
Folding the cursor update into the claim transaction remains open.

### 3.9 `human_gate`

```sql
-- 0008_human_gate_artifact_budget.sql
CREATE TABLE human_gate (
    gate_id     uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    job_id      uuid REFERENCES job(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    kind        text NOT NULL,     -- free text; see below
    prompt      text NOT NULL,
    options     jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
    default_answer text,
    answer      jsonb,
    raised_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    timeout_at  timestamptz,
    answered_at timestamptz,
    answered_by text
);

CREATE INDEX human_gate_open ON human_gate (project_id, raised_at)
    WHERE answered_at IS NULL;
```

`kind` is unconstrained text. Values raised by handlers today include `question`,
`choice`, `approval`, `attempts_exhausted`, `budget_exhausted`,
`escalation_exhausted`, `verify_repair_exhausted`, `integrate_repair_exhausted`,
`handoff_gate_failed`,
`too_many_wind_downs`, `deploy_interview`, `deploy_acceptance`,
`deploy_demo_review` and `deploy_failure_triage`. Bounded repair and escalation
ladders park on these gates rather than failing (ADR-0024). Gates are answered
with `vibey answer GATE_ID`.

### 3.10 `artifact` and `budget_ledger`

Provisioned by 0008; not yet read or written by any repository. Artifacts are
recorded as `ArtifactProduced` ledger events, and spend as `BudgetSpent` events
summed in memory (`domain/projections.py::build_cost_report`).

```sql
-- 0008_human_gate_artifact_budget.sql
CREATE TABLE artifact (
    artifact_id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    project_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle       integer NOT NULL,
    kind        text NOT NULL,       -- spec | demo | migration | diff | report | transcript
    path        text NOT NULL,
    digest      text NOT NULL,
    produced_by text,
    seq         bigint NOT NULL,
    created_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE budget_ledger (
    project_id  uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    cycle       integer NOT NULL,
    phase       phase NOT NULL,
    engine_id   text NOT NULL,
    turns       bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    tokens_in   bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    tokens_out  bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    dollars     numeric(12,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    PRIMARY KEY (project_id, cycle, phase, engine_id)
);
```

---

## 4. Notifications

```sql
-- After enqueue (PostgresJobRepository.enqueue, new rows only) and after a gate
-- answer re-readies its parked job (PostgresHumanGateRepository.answer):
NOTIFY vibey_job_ready, '<project_id>';

-- After PostgresHumanGateRepository.raise_gate (emitted; nothing LISTENs yet):
NOTIFY vibey_gate_raised, '<gate_id>';
```

Workers `LISTEN vibey_job_ready` (`infrastructure/db/notifier.py`) and wait at most
5 seconds before polling again, so a missed notification costs latency, never
correctness. No notification is sent on phase changes or when a circuit
half-opens; `EngineHealthService` only schedules `engine_health.probe_next_at`.

---

## 5. Serialization

**Phase transitions** are a compare-and-set on the `project` row, not a lock
(`PostgresProjectRepository.transition`):

```sql
UPDATE project
SET phase = $3, updated_at = now()          -- or: SET phase = $3, cycle = $4, …
WHERE id = $1 AND phase = $2
RETURNING *;
```

Zero rows means the project is no longer in the expected phase — another worker
already moved it, or the job is a replay — and the repository raises `ValueError`.
Handlers that must tolerate replay suppress that miss and continue with idempotent
work (for example `DeployDesignBridgeHandler`). There is no supervisor process; any
number of workers may attempt a transition and exactly one wins.

**The integration branch** is guarded by a session-level advisory lock scoped to
`(project_id, cycle)` (`PostgresAdvisoryLock`, ADR-0029):

```sql
SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock($1);   -- $1 = signed int64 of sha256('vibey.integrate:<project_id>:<cycle>')[:8]
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1);
```

`try_acquire` never blocks; contention is the caller's cue to defer the job. A held
lock pins its pooled connection until release, because returning the connection to
the pool would drop the lock silently.

---

## 6. Retention (planned)

Nothing is pruned, partitioned or garbage-collected today. Every table grows
without bound, `event` is a single heap table (0002), and there is no `vibey gc`
command. `vibey ledger` exposes only `show`. The intended policy, none of it
implemented:

| Table | Intended policy |
|---|---|
| `event` | **never deleted** — it is the ledger. Cycles older than N move to a compressed partition by `(project_id, cycle)` once a project passes ~500k events, keeping the gate's range queries on the hot partition |
| `job` | `succeeded` rows pruned after 30 days; `failed` kept until acknowledged |
| `handoff` | kept with the ledger |
| `artifact` | rows kept; files garbage-collected by a future `vibey gc` when unreferenced by any open item |

---

## 7. Migrations

Plain SQL files in `migrations/`, forward-only, applied in lexical order, tracked in
`schema_migration(version, applied_at, checksum)`
(`src/vibey/infrastructure/db/migrator.py`). The migrator creates that table itself
before reading it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migration (
    version     text PRIMARY KEY,
    applied_at  timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    checksum    text NOT NULL
);
```

`version` is the file stem (for example `0011_deployment_stage_set_phases`) and
`checksum` is the sha256 hex of the file's text. Each pending migration runs in its
own transaction together with its `schema_migration` insert.

There is no `vibey migrate` command. `build_app()` in `src/vibey/bootstrap.py` calls
`apply_migrations(conn, discover_migrations(migrations_dir()))` every time it opens
the pool, so every CLI command that opens the database, and every worker start,
brings the schema up to date.
`migrations_dir()` resolves to `<checkout>/migrations` from a source tree and to
`/app/migrations` in the container image. Every start also re-verifies checksums:
`apply_migrations` raises `MigrationChecksumError` if an already-applied migration's
file has changed — an edited migration is a bug, not a convenience. A
`check_only=True` keyword (verify, apply nothing) exists on `apply_migrations` but
has no CLI flag and no caller yet.

`tests/infrastructure/db/test_migrator.py` applies the full set to a fresh Postgres
and asserts the expected tables exist, re-applies the set as a no-op, and re-applies
it over a database that already holds a `project` row. There is no per-version
upgrade fixture yet: no test seeds data at migration N−1 and then applies N.
