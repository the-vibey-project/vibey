## Goal

vibey runs as a long-lived server deployment, not a MacBook process:
containerized workers on Kubernetes, packaged as a Helm chart, autoscaled
by queue depth via KEDA, operated by a kopf-based operator, runnable
locally on minikube and hosted on AKS, EKS, and GKE. Engine sessions run
against LLM provider APIs/SDKs (API-key auth), since interactive
subscription login doesn't exist in a cluster.

## Current state (verified)

- `vibey worker` is a solid headless process already: Postgres queue
  (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), leases + reaping, `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, per-kind
  leases, advisory-locked integrates — worker death is already survivable
  (idempotent replay). This is 90% of being cluster-ready.
- vibey ships as a two-stage, non-root image (`deploy/docker/Dockerfile`,
  tini as PID 1 so SIGTERM reaches the worker's drain latch — ADR-0026) and
  a Helm chart (`deploy/helm/vibey/`: worker Deployment, in-cluster
  Postgres, KEDA `ScaledObject`, operator Deployment, `VibeyProject` CRD).
  CI builds the image for amd64 + arm64, asserts each `Image contract - …` step, and runs
  a minikube job with four cluster contracts (projectless worker parks,
  in-cluster project is picked up, the `ScaledObject` reconciles against
  real Postgres, a worker drains promptly on SIGTERM).
- Engines are still host CLIs: the image copies `src/vibey` only and
  carries no `*loop` binary, so in-cluster runs use `--provider scripted`.
  claudeloop et al. still authenticate via subscription login on the Mac.
- `infrastructure/container/runtime.py` holds container runtime helpers;
  `infrastructure/cluster_preflight.py` backs `vibey doctor --cluster` and
  already maps each of the four hosted-model engines (not qwenloop) to
  the API-key environment variables it accepts.

## Design

1. **Images**: one `vibey` base image (uv-built, non-root, distroless-ish)
   and one `vibey-engines` image layering the loop runners + their
   API-key configuration. Engine API-key mode: each runner must support
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY`/`GOOGLE_API_KEY` auth (runner-side
   work item where missing — subscription login is a TTY flow).
2. **Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/vibey/`): Deployments for `worker` (N
   replicas) and `server` (the FastAPI ingress from workstream 12 —
   webhooks, API, health); CloudNativePG-or-managed-Postgres option;
   Secrets for DSN + engine keys; ConfigMap for project defaults;
   PodDisruptionBudget; liveness = DB ping, readiness = migration status.
3. **KEDA**: `ScaledObject` on the worker Deployment using the
   **postgresql scaler** — query = ready-job count due now (the claim
   query's SELECT arm); min 0 / max N replicas. Long engine sessions are
   protected from scale-in by the worker's own SIGTERM drain -- finish the
   job in hand, claim no more -- bounded by terminationGracePeriodSeconds.
   Landed as a signal handler in the worker rather than a preStop hook: a
   preStop script cannot tell a running worker to stop claiming, and the
   drain has to be a property of the process, not of the pod spec.
4. **kopf operator** (landed at `src/vibey/infrastructure/operator/`, run
   as `vibey operator`; decision logic in
   `application/operator_projection.py`): a `VibeyProject` CRD — spec
   holds repo URL, budget caps, engine allow-list; the operator runs
   `vibey new`, watches phase, surfaces parks as CR status conditions +
   Kubernetes Events, and applies answers written into the CR
   (`spec.answers`) through the same service `vibey answer` uses. A 15 s
   level-triggered timer reconciles status. AKS/EKS/GKE-specific bits
   (workload identity per cloud) are to live in values presets:
   `values-aks.yaml`, `values-eks.yaml`, `values-gke.yaml`. These presets
   do not exist yet; the header comment in `values.yaml` mentions them
   ahead of their existence, and the Kubernetes guide says so.
5. **Worktrees in-cluster**: a PVC per worker for git worktrees; repos
   cloned via deploy keys mounted as Secrets.
6. **Keep-awake is a non-problem here** (10 covers desktops).

## Work items

1. Engine API-key auth across the five runners (per-runner work items).
   Open.
2. Dockerfiles + CI image builds (multi-arch: arm64 + amd64). Done for
   vibey (#73); engine images are 16.
3. Helm chart + kind/minikube smoke test in CI (helm install → seed a
   scripted-engine project → DONE local). Chart and minikube job done
   (#73); the CI contracts stop at pickup, not DONE. No `server`
   Deployment or PodDisruptionBudget yet.
4. KEDA ScaledObject + scale test (enqueue 20 jobs → replicas rise → drain
   → scale to zero). Done (#73); CI asserts reconcile and SIGTERM drain.
5. kopf operator + CRD + park-to-condition flow + answer application.
   The same operator later carries the plan-drift reconcile loop --
   see `17-plan-drift-reconciliation.md`, which builds directly on this
   CRD and its condition/Event plumbing. Done (#76).
6. Cloud presets: AKS/EKS/GKE values + workload-identity wiring (reuses
   workstream 03 tenants). Open.
7. `vibey doctor --cluster`: in-cluster preflight (DB, secrets, engines).
   Done (#74).
8. Runbook doc: `docs/guides/kubernetes.md`. Done.

## Verification

- minikube: `helm install` → full greeter run with scripted engines →
  DONE, zero manual steps; KEDA scales 0→N→0 observed. Partly done: the
  CI minikube job proves install, pickup, reconcile and drain; a full run
  to DONE is not in CI.
- One paid live greeter on minikube with API-key claudeloop. Open.
- AKS + EKS + GKE (open): chart installs, a scripted-engine project completes on
  each (managed Postgres), teardown clean.

## Needs from operator

The minikube path needs nothing new (CI runs it). Remaining: the 03 cloud
tenants and LLM API keys for API-key engine mode.

## Risks

- Engine subscription-vs-API pricing differs materially — budget caps are
  mandatory in cluster values (the brake now reads real spend).
- Scale-in during a 2h implement session. **Tested with a forced drain,
  and it failed the first time**: the worker had no signal handling at
  all, so a scaled-in pod kept processing jobs 77s after SIGTERM, and
  five "terminated" pods still held live Postgres connections while the
  Deployment reported 0/0 — scale-to-zero freeing nothing. Fixed by the
  SIGTERM drain above; pods now exit in 4-5s. Re-test this on every
  change to the worker loop: it is the failure mode that looks green
  from `kubectl` while being completely broken.
- CRD answer channel is a second write path to gates — it must call the
  same application service as `vibey answer` (single choke point).
