# The greeter live demo: a real project, real engines, one forced rotation

This runbook drives one small project ("a CLI greeter") end to end on real
`*loop` binaries: DESIGN through the interactive interview, BUILD on
engine-selected sessions, REVIEW with real automated gates, and DONE(local).
Along the way it demonstrates the two behaviors the whole design exists
for: **per-job engine rotation** and **the no-loss wind-down handoff**.

It costs real money (live claudeloop/agyloop sessions). The BUILD-phase
brake is the per-cycle cap you set at `vibey new` (`--max-cycle-dollars`,
enforced from the ledger's recorded `cost_usd`); without it BUILD spend is
uncapped. The worker's `--max-turns` / `--max-dollars` cap only the
ClaudeLoop process that runs the DESIGN interview and the BUILD
decomposition, not the BUILD engine sessions. Expect a few dollars across
the whole demo.

## Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL running locally, and `VIBEY_PG_URL` pointing at a database you
  own (never SQLite; see ADR-0002).
- At least two engines installed and authenticated — this runbook uses
  `claudeloop` and `agyloop`. `vibey doctor` will tell you which are ready.
- A clean working directory for the project repo.

## 1. Create the project

```bash
mkdir -p ~/demos/greeter && cd ~/demos/greeter && git init
vibey new greeter --repo . --max-cycles 3 --max-cycle-dollars 15
```

`vibey new` prints the project id and enqueues the first
`design.interview` job. Keep the project id: `vibey design accept` needs it
in step 4. Nothing runs yet — jobs run only inside a worker.

## 2. Record engine health

Selection is driven by the `engine_health` table. An engine with no
recorded conformance is **ineligible** — the worker will warn and never
select it. Record both:

```bash
vibey doctor --conformance --record
```

This runs the 9-check conformance suite against every installed engine and
persists preflight + conformance for the latest project — so it needs
`vibey new` to have run first; without a project it exits with "no
projects found" (use `--project` to target another project). Re-run it
whenever an engine is updated.

## 3. Start the worker

```bash
uv run --project <vibey-checkout> vibey worker --provider claudeloop --engines claudeloop,agyloop
```

- `--provider claudeloop` makes the DESIGN interview and the BUILD
  decomposition use live ClaudeLoop calls (the default `scripted` provider
  is for tests).
- `--provider qwenloop` is the sovereign alternative to the paid DESIGN
  provider (ADR-0027). It runs the interview on a local model
  (`QwenloopDesignProvider`: Ollama at `http://127.0.0.1:11434` with
  `qwen2.5-coder:14b`). A local model has no web access, so research reads
  operator-supplied evidence: set `VIBEY_EVIDENCE_DIR` to a directory holding
  one `<topic>.md` per research topic (`prior-art.md`, `libraries.md`,
  `api-docs.md`) whose first line is `source: <where it came from>`. A missing file makes the research job
  refuse rather than invent a source, and synthesis waits on every research
  job. In this mode the BUILD decomposition uses the scripted producer, not a
  live model. This demo uses claudeloop because it exercises paid-pool
  rotation.

  ```bash
  export VIBEY_EVIDENCE_DIR=~/demos/greeter-evidence
  uv run --project <vibey-checkout> vibey worker --provider qwenloop --engines claudeloop,agyloop
  ```

- `--engines claudeloop,agyloop` is the allow-list: BUILD jobs select
  between exactly these two via smooth-weighted round-robin, per job.
- To add qwenloop to the pool as a local standby engine (ADR-0015), export
  `VIBEY_FEATURE_QWENLOOP=1` before both `vibey doctor` and `vibey worker`.
  `[features] qwenloop = true` in `vibey.toml` is honored by `vibey doctor`
  but not by the worker, which reads the project's stored config.
- Launch the worker with `uv run` from the vibey checkout (`--project`), not a
  bare `.venv/bin/vibey`. Verify
  and integrate gate commands run with the worker's own environment, so
  `uv run` is what puts the venv's `bin` on `PATH` for gate binaries such
  as `python`.

The worker LISTENs on `vibey_job_ready`, so answers you give in another
terminal wake it immediately.

## 4. Answer the DESIGN gates and accept the design

The interview parks on human gates. In a second terminal:

```bash
vibey status               # AWAITING_HUMAN: 1 under Queue Depth means a gate is parked
psql "$VIBEY_PG_URL" -c "SELECT gate_id, kind, prompt FROM human_gate WHERE answered_at IS NULL ORDER BY raised_at DESC LIMIT 1;"
vibey answer <gate-id> system_description="a CLI that greets the user by name" --defaults
vibey answer <gate-id> --defaults          # later stages: take every default
```

`vibey status` shows only queue depth per job state, never a gate id or its
questions. The parked gate's id and prompt live in the `human_gate` table
(`answered_at IS NULL`); no CLI command lists them yet, so read them with
`psql`.

Question keys are minted by the model and vary per run — read them from the
gate prompt when you want to answer one explicitly. `--defaults` accepts
every default (blocking questions included) and combines with explicit
pairs, which win; it is the zero-touch path, so an unattended driver never
needs to parse anything.

Repeat until the interview completes. The worker then runs
`design.research` (three topics), `design.synthesize`, and `design.spec` on
its own. When `vibey status` shows no `AWAITING_HUMAN` jobs and those have
succeeded, accept the design. Acceptance is an explicit command, not a
gate:

```bash
vibey design accept <project-id> --no-visual
```

`--no-visual` (the default) declines the VISUAL_DESIGN interstitial and
enters BUILD directly — the greeter has no UI. `vibey watch` gives a live
dashboard of the queue, circuits, and ledger tail while you go.

## 5. Watch BUILD rotate

After acceptance, BUILD decomposes the spec into work items and runs
`build.implement` / `build.verify` jobs on engine-selected sessions:

- every job's selected engine is durable (`job.assigned_engine`);
- each item's **verifier is never its implementer**;
- `vibey engines` prints a snapshot of selection counts and circuit states;
  `vibey watch` keeps them live.

## 6. Force a rotation (the E1 milestone)

While a `build.implement` session is running on claudeloop, ask it to wind
down from another terminal:

```bash
claudeloop wind-down --cwd <repo>/.vibey/worktrees/<cycle>/<item-id> --reason demo
```

(or wait for a real window exhaustion). claudeloop honors the request at
its next natural break, after the turn in flight finishes, so a short
greeter session may complete before the request lands — trigger it early in
a session. The engine exits with code 75; vibey then:

1. writes this cycle's full BUILD ledger to
   `<worktree>/.vibey/handoff/ledger.jsonl`;
2. produces a handoff brief and verifies it against the no-loss gate
   (STRICT, escalating to FULL_TRANSCRIPT, parking for you only if even
   that fails);
3. persists the verified `HandoffEnvelope` (query the `handoff` table:
   `accepted` must be true);
4. enqueues a follow-up `build.implement` whose prompt is the rendered
   brief — every open question, decision, assumption, and finding id
   verbatim — with claudeloop durably excluded, so agyloop picks it up.

The wind-down job settles **Success**: rotation is not a failure and never
burns the escalation ladder. An item may rotate three times; a fourth
wind-down on the same item parks it for you as a `too_many_wind_downs`
gate.

## 7. REVIEW and completion

REVIEW produces the demo artifacts under `.vibey/runs/<cycle>/review/` and
runs the automated review (`ruff check .`, `bandit -q -r src`) against the
integrated result, then parks two gates in turn. Answer the review verdict
first, then decline deployment:

```bash
vibey answer <gate-id> --verdict accept       # review.collect approval gate
vibey answer <gate-id> --choice local_only    # review.deployment_choice gate
```

The project records DONE(local). `vibey cost` shows per-engine spend for
the cycle (ignore its `Cycle Budget Cap` and `Total Budget Cap` lines — they read an
unset `budget` key and print $40.00 and $250.00 regardless of
`--max-cycle-dollars` — and its
per-engine "turns" figure is the selection count, not turns);
`vibey status` should show an empty queue with zero failed jobs.

## If something goes wrong

- **"no projects found" from `vibey doctor --record`** — the project does
  not exist yet; run step 1 first.
- **"no recorded conformance" warning at worker startup** — step 2 was
  skipped or failed; engine-driven jobs will sit ready but unselected. A
  timing-flaky conformance FAIL is possible on a loaded machine: re-run
  `vibey doctor --conformance --record --engine <name>` once.
- **A job keeps deferring** — three causes, none of which `vibey status`
  names (it shows queue depth only): an open circuit (`vibey engines`), a
  capacity backoff, or a verify/integrate repair round in flight (a
  `build.implement` repair job for the same item is queued or running; the
  verify job re-checks every 10 minutes). The worker says so as it defers:
  one `job.deferred` line per deferral, naming the kind, the work item, the
  reason and the `retry_at` it will come back at -- a capacity deferral at
  WARNING, a routine repair wait at INFO. For a job that deferred before you
  were watching, the same reason is on the job row:
  `psql "$VIBEY_PG_URL" -c "SELECT kind, work_item_id, run_after, last_error->>'detail' FROM job WHERE state='ready' AND run_after > now();"`.
  Watch `vibey ledger show --kind FindingRaised` and `--kind FindingResolved`
  for the repair round to close. Circuits and backoffs clear on their own;
  an open circuit past its reset deadline half-opens automatically at the
  next selection and closes itself on the first success.
- **A `job.heartbeat_failed` warning** — a lease heartbeat could not reach
  Postgres (a pool timeout, a failover). The worker keeps running and
  retries at the next beat; one line is a blip, a run of them means the
  database is unreachable and the lease will lapse.
- **A `job.lease_lost` or `job.<ack|nack|grant|park|defer>_rejected`
  warning** — this worker's lease on the job expired (the handler outlived
  it, or heartbeats kept failing) and the row was reaped or claimed by
  another worker. The worker stays up, but the outcome it just produced was
  not recorded; the job runs again under whoever holds it now.
- **A `verify_repair_exhausted` / `integrate_repair_exhausted` gate** —
  the item burned its bounded repair rounds. Grant more with
  `vibey answer <gate-id> --raw '{"max_rounds": 6}'` (the prompt suggests
  a value), or fix the branch by hand and answer anything to retry. Bounded
  ladders park with grants rather than failing (ADR-0024).
- **A `budget_exhausted` gate** — the cycle's ledger-recorded spend crossed
  `--max-cycle-dollars` (or `--max-cycle-turns`), or the next attempt's
  projected cost would. No further engine session starts until you raise
  the cap: `vibey answer <gate-id> --raw '{"max_dollars": 25}'` (add
  `"max_turns": N` to raise the turn cap too; the prompt suggests a value),
  or leave it parked to stop here.
- **An `escalation_exhausted` gate** — the item burned the six-rung effort
  ladder (the seventh attempt parks). Grant more with
  `vibey answer <gate-id> --raw '{"max_attempts": 10}'` (they run at the
  ladder's top effort), or fix the item by hand and answer anything to let
  the next verify pass.
- **A verify gate fails with `gate command could not start` (exit 127)** —
  the engine wrote a gate command (often `python`) whose binary is not on
  the worker's `PATH`. That is a failing gate the repair loop fixes, not a
  vibey failure, but launch the worker with `uv run` (step 3) so the
  venv's `bin` is on `PATH` for gate commands. Known open issue: engine
  sessions have been observed installing packages into vibey's own venv;
  if `vibey doctor` starts failing after a run, `uv sync` restores it.
- **A gate you don't recognize** — `vibey answer --raw '{"...": ...}'`
  covers any shape the typed flags don't.
- Workers are disposable: kill the worker any time; leases expire and the
  next worker replays idempotently.
